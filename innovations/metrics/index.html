      <h1>A Good Way For Non-programmer Managers To Improve Quality-of-code</h1>
      <p>The problem explained here is very common for distributed teams, where the product is created for ,
not for the team itself. Being a customer in such a project, how do you monitor and control the
without programming skills? If the answer is &quot;I trust my programmers&quot; you may suffer from some of
the following problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are afraid to change key programmers since each of
them possesses some unique knowledge about your product;</p></li>
<li><p>You can only hope that your code is of good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_quality">quality</a> because
your coders say it is;</p></li>
<li><p>You can&#39;t add new features freely since the product becomes unstable after every new change;</p></li>
<li><p>You feel that if you want to get higher quality-of-code you have to change programmers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These problems occur in many projects where the quality-of-code is not controlled and is not
managed. A common assumption is that good programmers produce good code and if you want to improve
the code you should hire better programmers. This assumption is wrong. Quality-of-code in your
product has to be controlled by you and now we will show you how to accomplish this.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-objectives?">What are your objectives?</h2>

<p>Programmers (coders, testers, analysts) are technical specialists whose motivation is based on .
Either you recognize them as &quot;gurus&quot; or their colleagues give them respect for their knowledge or
experience, it is better if they receive both. Unfortunately, in most cases money is not the first
priority for them.</p>

<p>In order to earn and retain the status of &quot;guru&quot; a programmer has to do something that no one else
can do. He or she must know the tricks in your software. After all, the more complex the software is
the higher their salary will be.</p>

<p>However, your objectives are different. Your business value is , and you want to invest into it, not
into programmers. You want to control it and you want to know that the product really belongs to
you, not to the people who know the tricks.</p>

<p>As you see, your objectives and your coders&#39; objectives are not aligned, in other words you work
against each other.</p>

<h2 id="quality-of-code-could-be-measured">Quality-of-code could be measured</h2>

<p>To align objectives and start sharing common goals, it is necessary to invent a that will represent
your objective and at the same time will impact the programmers&#39; motivation. The higher the metric,
the better the quality-of-code will be. At the same time, the benefits for programmers will be
higher, like salary and recognition.</p>

<p>We use two metrics: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">Code Coverage</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">Cyclomatic Complexity</a>. Each of them are calculated
automatically at each round of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration">continuous integration</a>.</p>

<p>tells you that the code is clear and simple and could be easily understood by new programmers (This
means no more &quot;tricks&quot;). Cyclomatic complexity is one of the most important
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_metric">software metrics</a>
used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_code_analysis">static code analysis</a>.</p>

<p>tells you that for each block of code there exists a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit test</a> that validates it. The biggest benefit of unit
tests is that once the code is tested it stays workable when its author forgets how it works.</p>

<p>In our management panel you get a graph that indicates current value of the metric and a history of
change, like you see in the sample below:</p>

<p class='tikz'><img src='/tikz/e46a13f5d471b2260118c4f9a08e6e54.png' alt='tikz' width='80%'/></p>

<p>This graph is available for you and your coders. It is instantly updated by our software according
to the source code from SVN repository.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-do-this-technically">How we do this technically</h2>

<p>There are five components of the whole process: <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">SVN</a>,
<a href="http://continuum.apache.org">Continuum</a>, <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven2</a>, Gist and thePanel.
Coders as usualy commit their changes to SVN, and you monitor quality-of-code in our online project
management system (thePanel):</p>

<p class='tikz'><img src='/tikz/3a3288bf007ee144e9bd572ffa5a5cc5.png' alt='tikz' width='80%'/></p>

<p>The cycle is repeated every day and is initiated by Continuum, an open-source continuous integration
software by <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Group</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Coders commit changes to the SVN repository</li>
<li>Continuum checks out the changes and starts the builder (Maven2)</li>
<li>Maven2 compiles the code and runs unit tests</li>
<li><a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>-like framework produces a code coverage report</li>
<li>A language-specific tool calculates cyclomatic complexity</li>
<li>The transmitter (Gist) sends <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML">XML</a> report to thePanel</li>
<li>thePanel converts metrics into <b>bonuses</b>, for coders</li>
<li>You get the quality-of-code instantly</li>
</ol>

<p>This process is absolutely transparent for you and the coders. Everything below the dotted red line
in the diagram above is not visible to anyone. Coders commit changes to SVN together with unit tests
and get feedback in form of bonuses. You monitor the values of metrics.</p>

<p>We use our own simple cyclomatic complexity calculator
based on <a href="http://www.mccabe.com">Thomas McCabe&#39;s</a> principles.
Code coverage is calculated by
<a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a>,
<a href="http://www.phpunit.de">phpUnit</a>
(in combination with <a href="http://www.xdebug.org">xdebug</a>),
<a href="http://www.nunit.org">NUnit</a> or
<a href="http://cppunit.sourceforge.net">CPPUnit</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-pros-and-cons?">What are the pros and cons?</h2>

<p>This approach aligns the objectives of you and your coders
and returns control of quality-of-code to your hands. You get these benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code is always fully covered by unit tests</li></li>
<li>Code is clear and simple</li></li>
<li>No more &quot;indispensable&quot; programmers</li></li>
<li>The more you spend, the better the product</li></li>
</ul>

<p>Your programmers also get these benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Higher motivation because of a clear numeric objective</li></li>
<li>More confidence in code stability, less stress</li></li>
</ul>

<p>The only disadvantage we experienced after implementation
of this method was the necessity to spend time explaining this new approach
to programmers, 2-4 weeks at most.</p>
