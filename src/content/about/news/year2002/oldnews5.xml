<p>From TPC's participants, the conference was a great educational event 
providing the unique opportunity to communicate face-to-face with the leading 
world's ASP.NET professionals, and discuss many questions directly with them 
and many other ASP.NET developers.  The conference's key speakers included Rob 
Howard - the ASP.NET program manager from Microsoft and John Peterson - 
webmaster at ASP 101. </p>

<p>The conference discussed the newest features of .NET and ASP.NET, outlined 
the skills needed to develop software with ASP.NET, provided tutorials on how 
to apply this new technology in applications and web services and how to apply 
ASP.NET in creating real world solutions. </p>

<p>ASP.net Developer Conference &amp; Expo 2002 is a technical informational event, 
held for the first time this year in San Jose, CA. According to the Conference 
organizers, "ASP.net Developer Conference &amp; Expo 2002 is designed for both the 
experienced ASP programmer who must stay on top of the newest capabilities of 
ASP.NET, as well as for newcomers to this architecture who need an introduction 
to ASP.NET."</p>
