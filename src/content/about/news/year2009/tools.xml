    Software project managers now have a new tool in their arsenal when it
    comes to risk identification - a game. Developed by TechnoPark Corp., this
    innovative new method will be unveiled at the TOOLS 2009-hosted SEAFOOD '09
    conference. Already field tested, this method has been shown to save considerable
    time and costs and improve the quality of risk identification.

    <p>Naples, FL, June 23, 2009 - On July 3, 2009, attendees at
    the [TOOLS EUROPE 2009](http://tools.ethz.ch/)-hosted event
    [SEAFOOD '09](http://seafood.ethz.ch/2009/) (the Third International
    Conference on Software Engineering Approaches for Offshore and Outsourced
    Development), which will be held at ETH Zurich, Switzerland on July 2-3, 2009,
    will learn how TechnoPark Corp.'s CEO, Yegor Bougaenko, has developed and
    identified a game as a superior choice for certain risk identification
    scenarios for software projects.</p>

    <p>The method detailed in the paper Bougaenko will present had its
    genesis last summer in a large, risky project for one German customer.
    Since none of the methods to identify project risks were suitable for the
    online-chat environment needed by its distributed team, TechnoPark developed
    its own method. The paper is especially relevant to this year's
    SEAFOOD theme, "Enabling Global Partnerships to Deliver on Business Needs,"
    as it is specifically tailored to instances where, among other factors, the
    project team is multi-lingual and distributed. However, in line with TechnoPark's
    efforts to "create value for all companies, the method is appropriate
    even for mono-lingual teams in a concentrated location," mentions Bougaenko. </p>

    <p>"Since project management is a difficult discipline, while risk management is
    especially so, TechnoPark aims to simplify complex things, ensuring
    success in our customers' projects through professional project management. This
    method is an excellent example of our latest research in this direction," says
    Arthur Petrenko, TechnoPark's Marketing Director. "In fact, this method resulted
    in a savings of over 200 man-hours and more than 9% of budget on the
    very first project we deployed it on," adds Petrenko. </p>

    <p>Interested parties can obtain the conference materials from TechnoPark Corp., who will
    make them available for download on its website right after the end of
    the conference. Conference materials will also be published
    by [Springer Verlag](http://www.springer.com/).</p>

    services to companies worldwide. TechnoPark effectively manages extreme requirements,
