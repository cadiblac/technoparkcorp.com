<title>TechnoPark  Corp. Launches Social Web Project</title>

<description>TechnoPark Corp. recently began work on a new social and
 political web property that will merge popular features of YouTube and
 MySpace.</description>

<text>

<p>The site will connect users seeking social and political interaction
 using state-of-the-art video blogging and conferencing technologies.
 With this product, TechnoPark seeks to change the landscape of online
 politicking by giving a powerful new platform where candidates, proponents,
 and opponents can meet "face to face" through near real time and archived
 video.</p>

<p>Built with PHP/Flash, the site has yet to be named but the name will reflect
 the changing face of political debate and information delivery.</p>  

<p>The project is being developed on a PHP/Macromedia Flash platform and will
 require an estimated 1,350 staff hours to complete.</p>
