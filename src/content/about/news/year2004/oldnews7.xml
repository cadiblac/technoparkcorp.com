<description>November 15-19, 2004 -- TechnoPark Corp. extended its testing 
knowledge and skills at STARWEST Conference 2004 devoted to software testing 
and quality assurance.</description>

<text>
<p>TechnoPark Corp. (TPC) visited the conference as an attendee. The attendance was 
aimed at enhancing company's skills in testing process by exchanging experience 
with other software testing professionals. TPC's team visited tutorials and 
keynote reports on different testing aspects.</p>

<p>STARWEST 2004 focused on test case design. As long as a tester can create 
numerous test cases for any application, the test case design must be smart, 
not hidebound. Techniques helping to create smart test cases and save  
time and effort were presented during the conference. In addition to this 
problem, conference participants discussed testing automation and software 
testing outsourcing. </p>

<p>While discussing test management, the conference pointed out that 
relationships between test or QA group and developers were very important 
independently of what testing methodologies and approaches are used in company.</p>
  
<p>STARWEST 2004 took place in Anaheim, CA on November 15-19.</p>
