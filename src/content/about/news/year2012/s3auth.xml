    TechnoPark Corp. sponsors a free hosted service for Amazon S3
    bucket owners who need HTTP Basic authentication for their private content

        <p>
        We sponsored a small hosted service for owners of Amazon S3 buckets:
        <a href="http://www.s3auth.com/">s3auth.com</a>. Amazon S3 doesn't
        provide an ability to deliver private content through HTTP Basic/Digest
        authentication mechanisms. Our hosted service fills this gap.
        </p>
        <p>
        The product already received good feedback from users worldwide.
        What is especially interesting is that the web service is fully
        open source and hosted at <a href="https://github.com/yegor256/s3auth">github</a>.
        The service itself, of course, is hosted at Amazon EC2.
