        TechnoPark Corp. have been an active user of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the
        the last three years. In our software solutions we're actively using
        Elastic Beanstalk, S3, EC2/EBS, CloudFront, and other services of AWS.
        <a href="http://www.s3auth.com/">s3auth.com</a> was one of the latest
        products developed and made public by our team.
        </p>
        <p>
        A few days ago we were qualified by AWS
        as a Standard Technology Partner. This new title makes TechnoPark
        a reliable and trustable developer of your software projects.
