        Yegor founded the company when he was 23 years old, in order

        Yegor has been dedicating recent years of his career to the research and development of
        software methodologies designed to improve quality. He is a regular academic
        writer and an author of almost all proprietary patent-pending
        and open source innovations of the company, including
