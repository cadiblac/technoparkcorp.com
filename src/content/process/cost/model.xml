    <p>Payments are done according to an approved [Schedule](/process/time/schedule).
    Each payment is connected
    to a certain Milestone, and is paid when all of the acceptance criteria is met by
    the project team.</p>

    <p>What is important for the project is to keep total amount of
    payments received higher than actual project cost, as total amount of
    staff-hours paid for task executors.
    This diagram shows the dynamic nature of project payments:</p>

    <p>You will make payments (P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, P<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>4</sub>) in order
    to cover actual cost of the project, but strictly according to
    the approved Schedule document with a list of Milestones (M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, and M<sub>3</sub>)</p>

    <p>We accept different payment options: cashier checks, wire transfers to
    US bank account, credit cards ([Visa](http://www.visa.com),
    [MasterCard](http://www.mastercard.com),
    [AmEx](http://www.americanexpress.com)).</p>
