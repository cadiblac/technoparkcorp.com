    Project budget is calculated and estimated in staff-hours. We
    use our own patent-pending technology for budget calculation.

    <p>We calculate, communicate and define the Budget in [staff-hours](/process/cost/prices).
    The actual monetary size of a
    project is a multiple of staff-hours and price per hour.</p>

    <p>We use our proprietary patent-pending method (USPTO patent 12/193,010) for Budget
    estimation and calculation.</p>

    <p>The Budget covers all costs, including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>[Requirements Development](/process/scope)</li>
        <li>Project Management</li>
        <li>Architecture and Design</li>
        <li>[Testing](/process/quality) and Quality Assurance</li>
        <li>Deployment</li>
        <li>[Defect-removal](/process/warranty/defectremoval)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Budget is paid only for [Deliverables](/process/warranty/deliverables), not for
    the time spent. It does not include
    [maintenance](/process/warranty/support}">support</a> and other <a href="${url:process/warranty/support) services.</p>

    <p>The Budget is calculated by the project team using Functional
    [Requirements](/process/scope/requirement). Each Requirement
    is estimated by programmers and then the total
    project programming effort can be calculated.
    Efforts for other project disciplines are
    calculated using the amount of hours for programming.</p>

    <p>The Budget is changed only when changes are made to scope by [Change Requests](/process/scope/changerequest).</p>
