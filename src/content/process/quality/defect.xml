    <p>A Defect is a non-conformance of [Deliverables]({% href process/warranty/deliverables %})
    to [Specification]({% href process/scope/specification %}). Defects can be found by
    testers, project team members or you. No matter who identifies a Defect, it has to be removed.</p>

    <p>Defects are stored in Defect Tracking System. Every customer will have access
    to this online system.</p>

    <p>This is an example of properly reported Defect:</p>

<pre>
Visibility: high
Repeatability: often

Platform: Windows XP
Browser:  MS IE 7.0
Defect:   Being a registered user, I'm trying to
      change my personal avatar in my account.
      However, I can not upload TIFF file as
      avatar. Browser waits for 30 seconds then
      says that there is no reply from server.
      The same function works properly in
      FireFox and Opera.
Reported: by Alex
Date:     8-Jul

    <p>Properly reported Defects are easy to track, monitor and remove.</p>

    <p>For each [Iteration]({% href process/time/iteration %}) we plan certain amount of Defects that may be found,
    and testers perform all necessary procedures to prepare for that amount of Defects.
    Test Plan is created by a test analyst at the beginning of each Iteration in the form of guidance
    for testers. Test Plan leads testers through product functionality and helps them to
    reveal the most critical Defects.</p>
