    <p>[Incremental delivery](/process/communication/incremental) means
    that a software product is created, [tested](/process/quality) and delivered to you
    in a number of builds. Each build has a new portion of functionality. A new build
    is delivered by the end of each [Iteration](/process/time/iteration).</p>

    <p>The Iteration Acceptance Meeting is an online meeting (20-40 minutes) where the project manager
    presents Iteration results and explains them. You review the results,
    and confirm what new functionality was accepted during Iteration (and what was not).</p>

    <p>Typical agenda of Iteration Acceptance Meeting:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What was the plan for Iteration</li>
        <li>What was completed and accepted by the customer</li>
        <li>What failed and why</li>
        <li>Current project [mitigation plans](/process/risk}">risks</a> and <a href="${url:process/risk/strategy)</li>
        <li>Earned Value Analysis data ([SPI](/process/time/spi), etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Iteration Acceptance Meeting is the most important activity because the project team
    receives your feedback about project results.</p>
