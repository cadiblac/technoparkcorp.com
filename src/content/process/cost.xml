<description>
    We estimate cost of a project in two steps, minimizing the
    risk of over and under estimation. ROM estimate preceeds Budget.

    <p>We do projects in fixed-price contracts, meaning that the price is defined
    according to [scope](/process/scope) definition
    and is not changed unless there are changes to [Specification](/process/scope/specification).
    We take all risks of cost overrun so that you
    pay only the price defined in project [Budget](/process/cost/budget).</p>

    <p>Our two-step quotation process has a number of important advantages:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Final budget is optimal, without extra costs and reserves</li>
        <li>Guarantees "win-win" outcome for you and us</li>
        <li>Avoids cost overrun</li>
        <li>Guarantees project success</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We calculate and communicate all project costs in staff-hours. Actual monetary size of
    project is a multiple of staff-hours and [price per hour](/process/cost/prices).</p>

    <p>Cost is estimated in two steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>[ROM Estimate](/process/cost/rom) and Retainer</li>
        <li>Budget</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The ROM Estimate is provided to you in response to your informal request
    and is based on the [Vision](/process/scope/vision) document.
    ROM Estimate gives a range (low and high boundary) of the expected Budget.
    You approve the range
    and the project team performs [requirements](/process/scope/requirement) gathering
    and analysis during the [Inception Phase](/process/scope/inception).
    These steps result in the creation of a
    [SRS](/process/scope/srs) document.</p>

    <p>When the SRS is ready and you approved it, the project team estimates project Budget
    as an exact amount of staff-hours. The Budget can only be within the range provided in ROM Estimate.
    Upon your approval of the Budget, the project continues.</p>

    <p>If you don't approve the Budget for any reason, you pay only the Retainer, which
    covers the efforts for Requirements gathering and Specification development.</p>

    <p>[Payments](/process/cost/model) are made according to Milestones defined in the
    [Schedule](/process/time/schedule), which is approved together with the Budget.</p>

    <p>Budget covers all costs, including programming, requirements analysis, management,
    project management, architecture and design, testing and quality assurance.</p>
