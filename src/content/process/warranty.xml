    <p>As stated in our software development contract, a software project is closed when
    [Quality]({% href process/quality %}) is acceptable. That means that 95% of functional
    [SRS]({% href process/scope/requirement}">Requirements</a> from <a href="${url:process/scope/srs %}) do not
    have any [Defects]({% href process/quality/defect %}).</p>

    <p>Since 100% Quality is not attainable, [Deliverables]({% href process/warranty/deliverables %}) have many more
    Defects than you or our testers can reveal in a limited amount of [time]({% href process/time %}). Project
    acceptance criteria is a situation when Deliverables do not have critical Defects that
    block product release.</p>

    <p>We provide defect removal service free of charge during one calendar year
    after project completion. Such service includes removal of any Defects you find
    in Deliverables.</p>

    <p>There is a difference between Defect removal and [support services]({% href process/warranty/support %}).
    We do not provide [support services]({% href process/warranty/support %}), which include
    server administration, end-user support, search engine optimization, etc.</p>
