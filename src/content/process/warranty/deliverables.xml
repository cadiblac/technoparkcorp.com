    <p>Deliverables are what you pay for and what the project team produces. There
    is nothing more important in a project than the Deliverables.</p>

    <p>You receive the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Commented Source Code with unit-tests;</li>
        <li>Compiled products (executables);</li>
        <li>Specifications in original format ([Vision](/process/scope/srs}">SRS</a>, <a href="${url:process/scope/vision));</li>
        <li>User manual</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Project documentation includes, but is not delivered under contract:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>[Schedule](/process/time/schedule)</li>
        <li>Software Architecture Document (SAD)</li>
        <li>Test Plan (w/ Test Cases)</li>
        <li>Software Development Plan (SDP)</li>
        <li>[Iteration](/process/time/iteration) Plans</li>
        <li>Meeting Protocols</li>
        <li>[Traceability Matrix](/process/scope/matrix)</li>
        <li>[Risk List](/process/risk/risklist)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You have an access to all project documentation, but we are
    not contractually obliged to deliver it.</p>
