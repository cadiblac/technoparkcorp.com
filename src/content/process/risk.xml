    Risk management is a core component of our project management
    methodology. Some risks are transfered to customer during inception phase.

    <p>A Risk is a possible event that may impact the outcome of a project.</p>

    <p>All Risks are identified during the [Inception Phase](/process/time/inception) and a
    [Risk List](/process/risk/risklist) is developed which includes mitigations and contingencies
    plans for each Risk.
    Usually, a Risk List identifies up to 20 areas of concern.</p>

    <p align="center"><tikz>
\begin{tikzpicture}
    [node distance = 2.5cm,
    auto, thick]

    \node [block, text width=3.3cm] (identification) {Risk identification};
    \node [block, below of=identification] (riskplans) {Development of risk plans};
    \node [block, text width=3.5cm, below of=riskplans] (strategies) {Customer selects Risk Strategies};
    \node [block, text width=5cm, below of=strategies] (changes) {Changes to Scope, Cost and Specification};
    \node [choice, text width=2cm, below=1cm of changes] (lco) {LCO Milestone};

    \path [line] (identification) -- (riskplans);
    \path [line] (riskplans) -- (strategies);
    \path [line] (strategies) -- (changes);
    \path [line] (changes) -- (lco);

    \node [draw=tpcBlue, dashed, fit=(identification) (riskplans) (strategies) (changes)] (group) {};

    \node [right=1cm of group, text width=3cm, inner sep=5mm]
        {This activites are performed first time during Inception Phase, and later on each Iteration};
\end{tikzpicture}
    </tikz></p>

    <p>You select a strategy for addressing each Risk and the [Scope](/process/scope),
    [Cost](/process/cost),
    and [Schedule](/process/time/schedule) are adapted according to Risk response plans.</p>

    <p>Besides this formal procedure of Risk Strategies acceptance we
    conduct a full-scale risk management in each [Iteration](/process/time/iteration), including
    risk identification, analysis, and response planning.</p>
