    <p>The Lifecycle Objectives (LCO) Milestone is a moment when the [Specification]({% href process/scope/specification %}),
    [Schedule]({% href process/cost/budget}">Budget,</a> and the <a href="${url:process/time/schedule %}) are ready
    and presented to you for approval.</p>

    <p>At this point, you examine the Lifecycle Objectives of the project, and decide either
    to proceed or to cancel it.</p>

    <p>If the project is approved at this moment, we continue to work.</p>

    <p>If project is not approved for any reason, project is closed and you pay only the
    [Retainer]({% href process/cost/retainer %}) for the work done on Specification development.</p>
