    <p>When a [ROM Estimate]({% href process/cost/rom %}) is approved and the project
    is started, the project team has documentation that you provided to us - we call it
    an informal request (also called stakeholder request in
    <a href="http://www.ibm.com/rational">RUP</a>).</p>

    <p>Your informal requests may include diagrams, specifications, spreadsheets, and other forms.
    All of this information is very important to the project team.
    This information shall
    be converted to [Specification]({% href process/scope/specification %}), as required by our process.
    This is the goal of the Inception Phase - to
    convert your informal requests into very detailed and well-structured Specifications.</p>

    <p>Inception Phase includes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Refining the scope of the project</li>
        <li>Project planning</li>
        <li>Risk identification and analysis</li>
        <li>Preparing the project environment</li>
        <li>Estimating the [Budget]({% href process/cost %})</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Inception Phase is finished when Specification, [Schedule]({% href process/time/schedule %}),
    [Budget]({% href process/risk}">Risks</a>, and <a href="${url:process/cost %}) are prepared and you reviewed them.
    Approval of these documents means a green light for the continuation of the project.
    The Inception Phase is finished
    with an [LCO Milestone]({% href process/time/lco %}).</p>

    <p>10-15% of the ROM Estimate average (time and effort) is usually spent on the Inception Phase
    by the project manager and system analyst.</p>
