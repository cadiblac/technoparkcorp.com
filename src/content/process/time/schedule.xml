<description>
    Schedule is a core time tracking/management document in the project, which
    collects together iterations, milestones and objectives. The document
    is kept current in our online project management system.

    <p>The Schedule is a coarse-grained project scenario, which splits the
    whole project into [Iterations](/process/time/iteration).
    Each Iteration delivers  a certain product functionality.
    The Schedule is created during the [Inception Phase](/process/time/inception)
    and is approved on an [LCO Milestone](/process/time/lco).</p>

    <p>The Schedule is kept current during the whole project.
    By having this document, you know
    when and what results or functions to expect.</p>

    <p>The Schedule is created by the project manager,
    right after you approve the [Specification](/process/scope/specification).
    Together, all Iterations cover the whole project scope as defined in the Specification.
    Overall, the Schedule is a central document in the project [time management](/process/time).</p>

    <p>We utilize the best practices of
    [Rational Unified Process (RUP)](http://www.ibm.com/rational) for the product lifecycle.
    Thus, the key mandatory Milestones in each project are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Lifecycle Objective (LCO) Milestone</li>
        <li>Lifecycle Architecture (LCA) Milestone</li>
        <li>Initial Operational Capability (IOC) Milestone</li>
        <li>Release Milestone</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Schedule is developed by the project manager in our online management system and you approve
    it with one click. The project moves on only when the Schedule had been approved.</p>

    <p>This is an example of a Schedule:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>#</th>
            <th>Objective</th>
            <th>Finish</th>
            <th>Staff-hours</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td></td><td>Project start</td><td>28-Jan</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>I1</td><td>Inception Phase</td><td>8-Feb</td><td>130</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M1</td><td>Budget Approval (LCO Milestone)</td><td>8-Feb</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>I2</td><td>Prototype (R1, R5, R9)</td><td>22-Feb</td><td>240</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M2</td><td>Architecture Baselined (LCA Milestone)</td><td>8-Feb</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>I2</td><td>R1, R3, R4, R8</td><td>22-Feb</td><td>240</td></tr>
        <tr><td>I3</td><td>R2, R5, R9</td><td>4-Mar</td><td>225</td></tr>
        <tr><td>I4</td><td>R6, R7, R10</td><td>18-Mar</td><td>310</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M3</td><td>Product Readiness (IOC Milestone)</td><td>18-Mar</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>I5</td><td>Transition Phase</td><td>3-Apr</td><td>180</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M4</td><td>Project finished (Release Milestone)</td><td>3-Apr</td><td></td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>The Schedule is tracked with a [Schedule Performance Index (SPI)](/process/time/spi),
    which shows you and the project team what progress has been made. The SPI
    is presented to you on each Iteration Acceptance Meeting.</p>
