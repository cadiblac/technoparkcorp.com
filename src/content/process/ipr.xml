    <p>Software development is very tightly connected with intellectual property that is
    created, managed, and transferred during project execution. We pay serious attention
    to such property, whether it is owned by you or by us.</p>

    <p>A [Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)]({% href process/ipr/nda %}) is signed prior to any communication on the software project.
    The NDA states that any confidential information disclosed by you is to
    be protected and we have no rights of republishing or redistributing any such information.</p>

    <p>Software development contracts limit our ability to transfer or disclose intellectual
    property created during project execution. We are incorporated in the United States and
    work according to
    <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/title17/">Copyright Law of the United States of America</a> -
    our services are titled in the contract as
    ["work made for hire"]({% href process/ipr/law %}).</p>

    <p>We protect Confidential Information in our offices and servers by means of a strict
    internal [Information Security Policy]({% href process/ipr/security %}) designed in
    compliance with ISO 27001.</p>

    <!-- <p>We are a proud holder of [TRUSTe Online Privacy Seal]({% href about/privacypolicy %})
    and a member of <a href="http://www.bbb.org">Better Business Bureau (BBB)</a>.</p> -->
