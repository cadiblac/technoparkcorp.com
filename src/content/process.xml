<description>
    Iterative and incremental process delivers full-scale project
    management methods and principles to your agile project, without
    bureaucracy and burden. We make the project management
    simple and easy-to-use by means of our automated instant metrics.

    <p>We implement full-scale PMBOK-inspired project management and
    make its every last detail valuable and easy-to-understand by means
    of instant automated metrics. Complex project management principles,
    documents, processes and rules are transparent for you with our
    project management web panel.</p>

    <p>Our software development lifecycle is iterative and incremental. We deliver software product
    by independent builds at the end of each [Iteration](/process/time/iteration).
    You approve [Schedule](/process/time/schedule) at the
    [LCO milestone](/process/time/lco) in the first weeks of a project, and then track it by
    [Earned Value](/process/time/spi) data.</p>

    <p>The diagram shows how your informal request is transferred to Deliverables,
    which you accept at the end of the project:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center"><tikz>
\begin{tikzpicture}
    [node distance = 2.5cm,
    auto, thick]

    \node [cloud, draw=tpcRed, cloud ignores aspect, fill=tpcRed!40] (request) {Informal Request};
    \node [block, below=0.8cm of request] (vision) {Vision};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of vision] (rom) {ROM Estimate};
        \node [block, below=0.5cm of rom.south east] (retainer) {Retainer};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of rom] (scheduleEstimate) {Schedule Estimate};
    \node [draw=tpcBlue, dashed, fit=(vision) (rom) (retainer) (scheduleEstimate)] (inception) {};

    \node [block, below=2.8cm of vision] (srs) {SRS};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of srs] (budget) {Budget};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of budget] (schedule) {Schedule};
        \node [block, below=0.5cm of budget.south east] (risks) {Risks};
    \node [draw=tpcBlue, dashed, fit=(srs) (budget) (risks) (schedule)] (projectBody) {};

    \node [choice, text width=2cm, below=2.5cm of srs] (lco) {LCO Milestone};

    \node [block, below=1.5cm of lco] (deliverables) {Deliverables};
    \node [block, below of=deliverables] (accepted) {Accepted Specification};

    \path [line] (request) -- (vision);
    \path [line] (vision) -- node [near end] {Requirements analysis and specification} (srs);
    \path [line] (srs) -- (lco);
    \path [line] (lco) -- node [right, text width=6cm] {Analysis, design, programming, testing and deployment} (deliverables);
    \path [line] (deliverables) -- node [right] {User Acceptance Testing} (accepted);

\end{tikzpicture}
    </tikz></p>

    <p>We work only with fixed-price projects that are estimated in two steps: 1)
    [ROM Estimate](/process/cost/rom)
    defines the range of effort and time required, 2)
    [Budget](/process/cost/budget) gives an exact amount of staff-hours required to complete the project.
    Such an approach optimizes costs of both parties.</p>

    <p>Software is developed according to Functional and Non-functional [Requirements](/process/scope/requirement)
    specified in [Specification](/process/scope/specification), in form of a
    [SRS](/process/scope/srs) document. Requirements are maintained in a
    [Traceability Matrix](/process/scope/matrix)
    that gives you and the project team the ability to bi-directionaly trace changes.
    We tend to be flexible, however, project Specification can only be altered through
    [Change Requests](/process/scope/).</p>

    <p>Our process is risk-driven, meaning that [Risks](/process/risk/risk) and
    [Risk Strategies](/process/risk/strategy) affect the
    project Schedule and Specification.
    During the entire project lifecycle, the project team reviews the
    [Risk List](/process/risk/risklist) containing the most critical Risks,
    and conducts Risk mitigation plans.</p>

    <p>[Deliverables](/process/quality}">Quality</a> of <a href="${url:process/warranty/deliverables) is assured by
    [unit-testing](/process/quality/unit),
    [peer reviews](/process/quality/peerreview),
    [manual testing](/process/quality/manual), and
    [system testing](/process/quality/system).</p>

    <p>Project [communications](/process/communication) are iterative and customer-focused.  They
    include [Daily Reports](/process/communication/dailyreport),
    [incremental delivery](/process/communication/incremental) of software product,
    regular [acceptance meetings](/process/communication/iam) with project status
    reporting and monitoring.</p>

    <p>We proactively protect [intellectual property rights](/process/ipr) of software by means of
    [Non-Disclosure Agreements](/process/ipr/nda) and
    [information security](/process/ipr/security) internal policies and rules.</p>

    <p>When a project is closed, we continue to provide warranty [defect removal](/process/warranty/defectremoval) services for
    [Deliverables](/process/warranty/deliverables).</p>
