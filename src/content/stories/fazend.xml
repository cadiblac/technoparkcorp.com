    <p>
        The development of <b><a href="http://fazend.com">FaZend.com</a></b>
        started in July 2009, when an open source PHP framework
        (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/fazend/">FaZend Framework</a>) was
        created and hosted at Google Code. The FaZend Framework was designed
        on top of <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a>,
        a very famous open-source web development toolkit, in order to
        make it more suitable for continuously delivered web systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        FaZend Framework proved its success with a number of open source
        and commercial web products. At the end of 2009 a group of
        engineers managed by our staff started the development of
        <a href="http://www.fazend.com">fazend.com</a>,
        a free hosted solution for continuous integration of
        PHP, Java, Python, and Ruby projects (this list is not exhaustive).
    </p>

    <p>
        Nowadays this platform is unique in its class because it combines
        together the service of private Subversion repository, Trac
        environment and continuous integration environment. The
        development is still in progress, but we already identify a
        significant success with this endeavor.
