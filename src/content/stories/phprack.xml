    A dedicated distributed team of PHP engineers sponsored
    by TechnoPark Corp. developed an open-source integration
    testing framework, called phpRack.

    <p>
        The design and development of <b><a href="http://phprack.com">phpRack</a></b> took almost 3 months
        for a team of 5 people, working in parallel and absolutely
        distributed (they never met each other face-to-face and never
        communicated online). There were engineers from Poland, Belarus, Czech Republic,
        and United States. The team communicated only through
        Trac and Subversion, using <a href="http://www.fazend.com">FaZend.com</a>
        Continuous Integration platform.
    </p>

    <p>
        The product is developed in PHP, with an extensive use of XML and JavaScript.
        We've used a number of frameworks and third-party tools, like PHPUnit,
        jQuery, JSLint, QUnit, Phing.
    </p>

    <p>
        The biggest challenge in the project was a necessity to invent the
        product, design it and develop at the same time. There were a number
        of risks related to this challenge. What helped us to mitigate the
        majority of risks is a [Puzzle Driven Development]({% href innovations/pdd %})
        concept, which was
        invented during that time and applied for USPTO patent.
        The project helped us to invent the PDD concept and to
        prove its effectiveness in a distributed team doing
        parallel programming.
