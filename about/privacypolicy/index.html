<h2 id="non-personal-information-collection">Non-personal information collection</h2>

<p>In some instances, TPC may collect non-personal (aggregate or demographic) data through cookies, web
logs, and web beacons. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability,
performance and effectiveness of our website.</p>

<h2 id="sharing-and-disclosure-of-pii">Sharing and Disclosure of PII</h2>

<p>We do not sell or rent your PII to third-parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us
permission to do so.</p>

<p>We may share your PII within TPC or any of our worldwide subsidiaries for purposes of data
processing or storage.</p>

<p>We may also share your PII with authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a
requested service or transaction. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share
your name and address with a shipping company. We only provide third-party agents with the minimum
amount of PII necessary to complete the requested service or transaction.</p>

<p>We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your PII and other related
information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend
against legal claims.</p>

<p>We may collect and possibly share PII and any other additional information available to us in order
to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of TPC&#39;s terms of use,
or as otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>While navigating TPC&#39;s web site you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a
third party supplier, not on TechnoParkCorp.com. This is typically done to host special events, such
as contests. When information is collected on behalf of TPC exclusively, TPC&#39;s privacy policy will
be referenced on the site and will govern how your information is used. For other, non-TPC sites,
the site owner&#39;s privacy policy will be referenced. It is TPC&#39;s practice to require such suppliers
to handle information in a manner consistent with TPC&#39;s privacy and security policies.</p>

<p>We will ask you for your opt-in consent to share your PII with a third party for any other reason.</p>

<h2 id="storage-and-security-of-pii">Storage and Security of PII</h2>

<p>TPC is committed to protecting the PII you share with us. We utilize a combination of security
technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your PII from unauthorized
access, use or disclosure.</p>

<p>When we transfer sensitive personal data (for example, credit card information) over the Internet,
we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. To learn more about SSL,
follow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer">this link</a>.</p>

<p>While we strive to protect your PII, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit.</p>

<p>We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your PII when you are on the Internet. For
example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating
passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about security on our website, you can
<a href="mailto:privacy@technoparkcorp.com">email us</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>

<p>Cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user&#39;s computer for record-keeping purposes. TPC
websites utilize cookies, although you can still access most of them even if you choose to disable
cookies in your browser. Some websites will not allow you to complete certain activities if cookies
are disabled.</p>

by following directions provided in your Internet browser&#39;s help file. To learn more about cookies,
follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">link</a>.</p>

<p>We store the identified of your latest login in cookie in order to avoid mutliple login requests
when there are delays in site usage. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you
don&#39;t have to enter it more than once. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the
interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p>

<p>We use multiple third parties to monitor web traffic, statistics, advertisement &#39;click-through&#39;, and
other activities on TPC&#39;s sites. Where authorized by TPC, such third parties may use cookies, TPC&#39;s
web log files, web beacons, and other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous aggregate
statistics on TPC&#39;s website visitors.</p>

<p>Current versions of web browsers offer enhanced user controls regarding the placement and duration
of both first and third party cookies. Search for &quot;cookies&quot; under your web browser&#39;s Help menu for
more information on cookie management features available to you.</p>

<h2 id="linked-websites">Linked websites</h2>

<p>Our websites may provide links to other third-party websites which are outside our control and not
covered by this policy. We encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) sites.</p>

<p>TPC classifies your PII as confidential information. Confidential information is protected by being
stored on secure servers that only select TechnoPark Corp. personnel have access to. The PII is
encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
