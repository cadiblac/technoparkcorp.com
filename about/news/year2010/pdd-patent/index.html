      <h1>Pdd, Patent Application No. 12/840,306</h1>
      <p>Patent application no. 12/840,306 has been submitted to United States Patent and Trademark Office on
21st of July by Yegor Bugayenko, lead architect of TechnoPark Corp.</p>

<p>The invention includes a specific method and software that resolves the problem of &quot;delayed
branches&quot; conflict in concurrent distributed software development, and in many other types of
software development projects.</p>

<p>Every time a developer is working with a branch and sees a problem or a question that needs the
participation of another programmer, he implements a temporary solution that keeps the code
compilable. He marks the place in the code with tag (called &quot;&quot;) and merges the branch into . The &quot;&quot;
includes the identifier of a task he was working with. As long as the &quot;&quot; stays in source code, a
project manager considers the task as incomplete and pending resolution. The project manager assigns
&quot;&quot; resolution to other team members. When all &quot;&quot; are resolved, the project manager returns the task
back to the programmer, asking him to continue with development.</p>

<p>The key advantage of the PDD method, comparing with all other known approaches, is the absence of
long branches. Implementation of every task, no matter how difficult it is, takes a few hours in one
iteration. Then the task is set to pending state and new &quot;&quot; are merged into . Project planning
becomes more predictable and simple, since the project manager is dealing with a large amount of
small isolated tasks, instead of long and risky activities. With this method, cost and scope control
also becomes more effective.</p>

<p>Properly used &quot;&quot; becomes the main management and communication mechanism in a distributed software
project, replacing e-mails, online discussions and phone calls. Moreover, the PDD software collects
&quot;&quot; from source code and builds short-term plans of key development tasks.</p>
