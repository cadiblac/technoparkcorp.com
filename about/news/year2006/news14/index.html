      <h1>Coaching Gets Easy With New Basketball Software</h1>
      <p>Realistic graphics and a wide variety of available actions, directions and models make the new
software &quot;Basketball Blueprint&quot; a great solution for coaches looking for a fun, easy way to teach
basketball drills and plays. The product is a .NET application providing a virtual basketball game
with a great number of variants.</p>

<p>Basketball coaches are the software&#39;s target audience. Taking into account that about 70% people are
visual learners, coaches often face the problem of misunderstanding when drawing up plays the
traditional way on chalkboards or dry-erase boards. Thus, a tool for vivid illustration of play
tactics is a great solution.</p>

<p>With Basketball Blueprint, coaches are able to create dynamic basketball drills and plays and
present them with vivid full color graphic animation.</p>

<p>Basketball Blueprint allows the user to model a basketball play or drill, which includes viewing an
object (player, ball, etc.) from different angles, placing and moving players, making passes and
shots, drawing arrows and other indicators in order to explain the situation, and showing the play
or drill in motion. Each play or drill can be saved. The software is supported by a website where
users can upload and download their files and thus share their experience and ideas.</p>

<p>The software is able to convert any saved drill or play into a printer-friendly format. This allows
a coach to print out a step by step storyboard and illustrate the strategy visually to his team. The
product is now being marketed on the Internet.</p>

<p>By now, Basketball Blueprint has received feedback from coaches who had already tried it.</p>

<p>&quot;Teaches the &quot;big picture&quot; without being too complicated. Other coaches are commenting that my
players have an excellent understanding of the game. Basketball Blueprint is helping me take their
skills to the next level,&quot; says Joe Alsman, basketball coach in Boone Terre, MO.</p>

<p>Basketball Blueprint is available at .</p>

<p>The product development was outsourced to the Ukraine. The software has been introduced by
outsourcing software development company TechnoPark Corp. &quot;The project seemed to be easy, however it
took much effort to make the game as realistic as possible. After the Basketball Blueprint release
we have monitored customers&#39; feedback, and now we think about starting development of the second
version of the software basing on end-users&#39; feedback.&quot; said Olga Totskaya, Project Manager at
TechnoPark Corp.</p>

<p>The software is easy-to-use and no special knowledge is needed. It will be useful for professional
and amateur basketball coaches as well as for basketball fans.</p>

<p>The project was developed as a standalone .Net application (Microsoft .Net Platform 2.0).</p>
