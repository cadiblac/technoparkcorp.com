      <h1>CISP/SDP Cerfitication In September</h1>
      <p>It may seem that too much is said about online payment security; still the problem is a crucial one
and is being globally ventilated. How to be sure my payment is secure? The question is burning for
all the links of the chain: payment service providers, applications developers, merchants, and cardholders.</p>

<p>Today, there is a unified approach to security standards. Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard (PCI DSS) is a list of unified standards and requirements for the industry. However, only
20% of the major industry-related companies are PCI DSS compliant. This is stimulated by mid-tier
merchants&#39; and service providers&#39; ignorance of the certificate though they are the most vulnerable
objects of attacks. According to WordPress&#39; report, many payment industry players feel the standard
is not clear or is not being applied prudently to encourage complete adoption.</p>

<p>Anyhow, PCI DSS must be the most comprehensive solution - and positively the best at this stage.
Visa together with world&#39;s major payment systems strongly encourages payment service providers,
merchants and payment applications developers to pass the PCI DSS compliance certification in order
to be able to guarantee high-level security to both their customers and partners.</p>

<p>Understanding the importance of security matter, TechnoPark Corp., an outsourcing software
development company, has released mobile payment processing system which meets all the standards
provided by PCI DSS. The system enables users to pay for goods and services using only their mobile
phones, and provides a number of additional functions like statistics, notifications, etc.
Laboratory testing assured the product&#39;s compliance, so it is about to be sent to Visa for certification.</p>

<p>PCI Data security standard was developed by Visa and MasterCard and accepted by other major players.
It provides 12 basic standards aiming to stamp out debit and credit card fraud, by introducing
strict security standards for handling and keeping cardholder data. The six general principles of
PCI DSS include the following: build and maintain a secure network, protect cardholder data,
maintain a vulnerability management program, implement strong access control measures, regularly
monitor and test networks, maintain an information security policy.</p>

<p>In the article devoted to data security standards Joan Herbig, President and CEO of Cambia Security,
a security policy enforcement provider, writes for CSO Magazine: &quot;Embracing the PCI standard may
sound like a big task, and you may wonder if it&#39;s even necessary for your business. However, before
you fill up your dance card with other priorities, consider this: As of now, there is no known case
of a PCI-compliant network being compromised.&quot;</p>

<p>For software developers Visa/MasterCard provides the PCI DSS Compliance Payment Application
Certificate. Only 50 payment applications have been validated by today. On the intense and
constantly growing market it sounds shocking. 50 is a tiny piece of all available products.</p>

<p>Moreover, the up-to-date list includes only 1 payment application for cellular phones - the most
fast-growing industry&#39;s tenderfoot (A survey from Visa USA, reported in Bank Systems &amp; Technology,
shows that 61% of the respondents ages 25 to 34 were interested in making purchases via their
cellphones). Still the adoption of PCI Data security standard may dramatically intensify anti-fraud efforts.</p>

<p>Thus, the major payment systems recommend choosing PCI DSS compliant services and products. It must
be a cue for US and European companies as well as worldwide outsourcing software development firms
striving to offer high-quality products. In light of this, the introduction of TechnoPark Corp.&#39;s
MPPS software and its compliance validation, scheduled for September 2006, is a piece of important
shift towards the consolidation of high standards of payment card industry.</p>
