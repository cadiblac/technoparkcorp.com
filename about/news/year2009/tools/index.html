      <h1>Tools Europe 2009 Attendees To Discover How Work Can Be A Game In Risk Identification</h1>
      <p>Naples, FL, June 23, 2009 - On July 3, 2009, attendees at the <a href="http://tools.ethz.ch/">TOOLS EUROPE
2009</a>-hosted event <a href="http://seafood.ethz.ch/2009/">SEAFOOD &#39;09</a> (the Third
International Conference on Software Engineering Approaches for Offshore and Outsourced
Development), which will be held at ETH Zurich, Switzerland on July 2-3, 2009, will learn how
TechnoPark Corp.&#39;s CEO, Yegor Bougaenko, has developed and identified a game as a superior choice
for certain risk identification scenarios for software projects.</p>

<p>The method detailed in the paper Bougaenko will present had its genesis last summer in a large,
risky project for one German customer. Since none of the methods to identify project risks were
suitable for the online-chat environment needed by its distributed team, TechnoPark developed its
own method. The paper is especially relevant to this year&#39;s SEAFOOD theme, &quot;Enabling Global
Partnerships to Deliver on Business Needs,&quot; as it is specifically tailored to instances where, among
other factors, the project team is multi-lingual and distributed. However, in line with TechnoPark&#39;s
efforts to &quot;create value for all companies, the method is appropriate even for mono-lingual teams in
a concentrated location,&quot; mentions Bougaenko.</p>

<p>&quot;Since project management is a difficult discipline, while risk management is especially so,
TechnoPark aims to simplify complex things, ensuring success in our customers&#39; projects through
professional project management. This method is an excellent example of our latest research in this
direction,&quot; says Arthur Petrenko, TechnoPark&#39;s Marketing Director. &quot;In fact, this method resulted in
a savings of over 200 man-hours and more than 9% of budget on the very first project we deployed it
on,&quot; adds Petrenko.</p>

<p>Interested parties can obtain the conference materials from TechnoPark Corp., who will make them
available for download on its website right after the end of the conference. Conference materials
will also be published by <a href="http://www.springer.com/">Springer Verlag</a>.</p>

<p>TechnoPark Corp. is a specialized project management firm providing quality development services to
companies worldwide. TechnoPark effectively manages extreme requirements, tight deadlines, and
limited budgets, setting the new standard in providing solutions to customers that are proven to be
both high value and high quality.</p>
