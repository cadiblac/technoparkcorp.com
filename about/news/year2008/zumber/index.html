    <meta name="description" content="The new search engine is a personalized, small system that
collects search information from different search engines
and then integrates it in one SERP. It can attract niche
customers, giving them the sum of what Google, Yahoo, MSN
and other giants can't give from one usable and intuitive
interface. Zumber.com's unique value is in it's search
engine model. It is simple, fast and relevant and brings a
lot of marketing opportunities.

      <h1>Technopark Corp Develops Their First Personalized Search Engine For A Niche Market</h1>
      <p>TechnoPark Corp., a custom software development company from Florida, finished the creation of the
configurable and personalized search engine. The product is available at <a href="http://www.zumber.com">www.zumber.com</a> domain.</p>

<p>TechnoPark Corp. plans to work with the niche search engine market during the next few years and
already has a contract with a German company to develop new niche search engine technology.</p>

<p>The search engine market is a market that never stands still. It is very young, but powerful and
profitable. Search engines pro se became a very rich channel for marketers and for prospect
attraction. Google, Yahoo!, MSN Search now are the sources of all information about the products and
services. From some point search engines can form a stable marketing position and either help to
build your business or to destroy it.</p>

<p>When speaking about search advertising, we can&#39;t neglect to say that it has the most significant
share of all on-line advertising. As IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau) had shown in its reports,
near 41 percent of all online advertising in 2007 was spent on search advertising. Research firm
ZenithOptimedia predicts US online ad spending to grow 23.4% in 2008. Global ad spending online will
rise 26.5% in 2008 to $47.7 bln.</p>

<p>TechnoPark Corp. provides the service of project management in software projects, banding
programmers, analysts, architects, testers and artitsts together in virtual teams. Due to a number
of patent-pending methods of project organization, estimation and coordination TechnoPark Corp. is
achieving efficiency and effectiveness in the software development marketplace.</p>
