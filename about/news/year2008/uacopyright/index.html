      <h1>Copyright Approval Is Announced For Technopark Corp.'s Online Project Management Materials</h1>
      <p><img name="/about/uacopyright.jpg" style="border: solid 1px #7d8f9b; float: left; padding: 0px;         margin-right: 15px; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px">Ukraine Copyright Certificate</img></p>

<p>In January 2008, TechnoPark Corp (TPC). applied for copyright protection on a series of online
documents that explain the company&#39;s unique project management process. Six months later, TPC is
pleased to announce that these documents have been successfully copyrighted.</p>

<p>There are over eighty pages of original TPC content created by TPC experts available at
<a href="/process">http://www.technoparkcorp.com/process</a>. While highlighting topics like time management,
cost, scope, quality, risk management, operations, communications, IPR, and delivery and warranty,
TPC has provided an in-depth guide to what clients and business partners should expect when using
TechnoPark Corp.&#39;s project management system.</p>

<p>Receiving copyright protection is of incalculable value to TPC. TechnoPark Corp.&#39;s Marketing
Director, Arthur Petrenko, says, &quot;It is inexpensive to buy copyright protection, but we feel
confident of the benefits. Displaying our unique procedure online helps prospective customers and
current business associates understand exactly what they will receive when they agree to use our
services. Having a copyright on that material means no other company can claim our expertise and our
process as their own. It protects us, but, more importantly, it protects Internet customers from
being misled by people who don&#39;t have our high standards and time-tested methods.&quot;</p>

<p>TechnoPark Corp.&#39;s project management process has been carefully crafted and put to the test by
clients and independent third parties. It was important to TPC that the documents meet and exceed
industry standards. To that effect, the eighty pages of online documents are compliant with PMBOK
requirements and CMMI.</p>

<p>PMBOK is a set of guidelines created to concentrate all knowledge of project management practices in
one guide. Twenty years ago, volunteers with pooled all their information regarding project
management. This became the book A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge. PMI is
recognized throughout the world as the leading Not-for-Profit organization dealing with all
information regarding project management.</p>

<p>is an approach that provides process improvement to organizations. CMMI has models and reports that
can be used when creating successful processes. They also suggest training so that senior managers
and employees alike will understand how a process impacts the way an organization can maximize their
performance and their profit.</p>

<p>TechnoPark Corp.&#39;s path to protecting their intellectual property will continue this year when TPC
applies for patents to protect their project management system in both the United States and the Ukraine.</p>
