      <h1>Technopark Corp. Collaborates With Extraget.biz On A Ppc Optimizer</h1>
      <p>TechnoPark Corp. has improved online marketing technology. By building specialized software tools
for ExtraGet.biz, TechnoPark Corp. meets the needs of a growing Internet business community.</p>

<p>ExtraGet.biz has launched a website devoted to advertising and marketing for today&#39;s businessperson.
ExtraGet.biz provides targeted business traffic, marketing information, and a devoted management
team to oversee services for its members.</p>

<p>TechnoPark Corp. created the Pay-Per-Click Optimizer which is at the heart of <a href="http://www.ExtraGet.biz">www.ExtraGet.biz</a>. This
PPC optimizer, created especially for ExtraGet.biz, tracks web traffic and improves the filtering of
fake visits and clicks.</p>

<p>The Pay-Per-Click process allows marketers to target their advertising by creating keywords. If an
Internet user searches for that keyword, the marketer&#39;s advertisement will show up. This helps the
Internet user find what they need and helps the marketer reach specific customers.</p>

<p>TechnoPark had to understand the current PPC technology in order to enhance it. Project manager for
TechnoPark Corp, Andrey Sadovsky, says &quot;We did significant research on web traffic and search engine
traffic. As a result we created a unique module for fraudulent clicks filtering.&quot; This new
streamlined system allows both the site user and the ExtraGet.biz member to find more value in their
ExtraGet.biz experience.</p>

<p>Online user experience is important because the competition between online marketing directories can
be tense. While the Internet has brought a stream of new customers to many businesses, it has also
allowed anyone with a website to set up an online marketing tool. By doing a quick search of the
Internet, a user will find directories charging outrageous fees, websites sporting misspellings and
disjointed language, and services that allow scammers to exploit their products.</p>

<p>With the help of TechnoPark Corp.&#39;s technology, ExtraGet.biz can offer specific business traffic,
professional service, and freedom from fraudulent clicks.</p>

<p>ExtraGet Corp. is a premier Global internet marketer and reseller company based in the Republic Of
Panama. TechnoPark Corp. is a US-based outsourcing software development company with a development
center in the Ukraine.</p>
