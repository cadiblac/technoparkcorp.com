TPC's team attended the conference in order to learn more about new web standards worked out by W3C 
and study best practices in the world of web development.

WWW2004 conference was organized by International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2). It 
was opened with keynote report by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Director of the W3C and inventor of the Web. 
In the report he outlined the previous year's achievements in web development, focused on most 
actual problems and made interesting proposals.

During Berners-Lee's report the discussion was mainly about Top Level Domains expansion. Recently it 
was offered to introduce more TDLs in addition to traditional .com, .org, etc. Some variants of new 
domain name extensions were spoken, such as .aero, .museum, .name, .bigco, and industry-specific 
domains like .xxx and .mobi. The speaker criticized the idea emphasizing that new TDLs must be 
created only as exeptions.

During the main conference, search systems development was discussed and a presentation of Amazon's 
A9.com search system was made. The second day covered Semantic web Applications. The WWW2004 
conference finished on May 21 with a traditional Developer's day.
