  TechnoPark Corp. took a participation in inventing and
  development of a new open methodology called eXtremely
  Distributed Software Development (XDSD). Now we are
  proposing its proprietary implementation to our first pilot
  clients.

[XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org) is a collection of principles of software development widely used in
open source world, but very rarely applied to commercial projects. When these ground rules (there
are four) are properly implemented in a project they guarantee higher quality of code and
significantly reduce risks of failure.

The XDSD principles are:

 * Everyone gets paid for verified deliverables
 * Defects are planned and don't block delivery
 * Quality-of-code metrics are CI gate conditions
 * VCS commits to are prohibited

A successful implementation of [XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org) in any particular project requires an
existence of certain tools, technologies, and skills, which typical project teams rarely, if ever,
possess. Institutionalization of these four rules in a software development team is a task of high
complexity, and will affect almost all aspects of business and social life of its members.
