Naples, FL (PRWEB) May 22, 2009 - On June 16, 2009, Yegor Bougaenko, CEO of TechnoPark Corp., will 
present a paper on a "Method for Software Cost Estimating Using Scope Champions" at [PROFES 
2009](http://www.profes2009.org), the 10th International Conference on Product Focused Software 
Development and Process Improvement, in Oulu, Finland from June 15-17, 2009.

This paper highlights the proprietary method behind TechnoPark Corp.'s software that uses a new 
revolutionary approach to software project cost estimating. Rather than estimating the entire 
project scope, Arthur Petrenko, TechnoPark's Marketing Director, explains that the "method estimates 
a very limited number of selective elements called Scope Champions, rather that trying to estimate 
the entire project. Then a formula is applied to calculate the total cost. Clients find this method 
saves time and improves accuracy of the estimate."

While TechnoPark applied for the method's patent last fall, Bougaenko decided to wait for the 
conference to unveil the process in order "to take advantage of PROFES' industry reach, as the 
number and breadth of companies there showcases companies' need for and commitment to the process 
improvement of software development, a sphere in which TechnoPark and its innovations excel," 
mentions Petrenko.

Non-attendees who wish to examine Bougaenko's paper will be able to do so when TechnoPark publishes 
the article along with presentation slides on TechnoPark's website immediately following the 
conference. Conference materials will also be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes of Computer 
Science (LNCS) Series.
