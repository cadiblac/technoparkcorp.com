Naples, FL, June 23, 2009 - On July 3, 2009, attendees at the [TOOLS EUROPE 
2009](http://tools.ethz.ch/)-hosted event [SEAFOOD '09](http://seafood.ethz.ch/2009/) (the Third 
International Conference on Software Engineering Approaches for Offshore and Outsourced 
Development), which will be held at ETH Zurich, Switzerland on July 2-3, 2009, will learn how 
TechnoPark Corp.'s CEO, Yegor Bougaenko, has developed and identified a game as a superior choice 
for certain risk identification scenarios for software projects.

The method detailed in the paper Bougaenko will present had its genesis last summer in a large, 
risky project for one German customer. Since none of the methods to identify project risks were 
suitable for the online-chat environment needed by its distributed team, TechnoPark developed its 
own method. The paper is especially relevant to this year's SEAFOOD theme, "Enabling Global 
Partnerships to Deliver on Business Needs," as it is specifically tailored to instances where, among 
other factors, the project team is multi-lingual and distributed. However, in line with TechnoPark's 
efforts to "create value for all companies, the method is appropriate even for mono-lingual teams in 
a concentrated location," mentions Bougaenko.

"Since project management is a difficult discipline, while risk management is especially so, 
TechnoPark aims to simplify complex things, ensuring success in our customers' projects through 
professional project management. This method is an excellent example of our latest research in this 
direction," says Arthur Petrenko, TechnoPark's Marketing Director. "In fact, this method resulted in 
a savings of over 200 man-hours and more than 9% of budget on the very first project we deployed it 
on," adds Petrenko.

Interested parties can obtain the conference materials from TechnoPark Corp., who will make them 
available for download on its website right after the end of the conference. Conference materials 
will also be published by [Springer Verlag](http://www.springer.com/).
