The most common and the most damaging assumption in software development is that "quality software 
has no bugs." In an article published on their website, TechnoPark Corp. explains that quality of 
software consists of the anticipation, discovery, and resolution of bugs. These three measures lead 
to a high quality of software products, and were successfully implemented in seven software projects 
completed by TechnoPark Corp. during the last year.

More details about these measures are available on the TechnoPark Corp. 
[website](http://www.technoparkcorp.com/innovations/test-planning). TechnoPark Corp. is a software 
development general contractor that uses automated innovative metrics to make complex full-scale 
project management simple and clear.
