The site will connect users seeking social and political interaction using state-of-the-art video 
blogging and conferencing technologies. With this product, TechnoPark seeks to change the landscape 
of online politicking by giving a powerful new platform where candidates, proponents, and opponents 
can meet "face to face" through near real time and archived video.

Built with PHP/Flash, the site has yet to be named but the name will reflect the changing face of 
political debate and information delivery.

The project is being developed on a PHP/Macromedia Flash platform and will require an estimated 
1,350 staff hours to complete.
