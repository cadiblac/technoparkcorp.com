From TPC's participants, the conference was a great educational event providing the unique 
opportunity to communicate face-to-face with the leading world's ASP.NET professionals, and discuss 
many questions directly with them and many other ASP.NET developers. The conference's key speakers 
included Rob Howard - the ASP.NET program manager from Microsoft and John Peterson - webmaster at 
ASP 101.

The conference discussed the newest features of .NET and ASP.NET, outlined the skills needed to 
develop software with ASP.NET, provided tutorials on how to apply this new technology in 
applications and web services and how to apply ASP.NET in creating real world solutions.

ASP.net Developer Conference & Expo 2002 is a technical informational event, held for the first time 
this year in San Jose, CA. According to the Conference organizers, "ASP.net Developer Conference & 
Expo 2002 is designed for both the experienced ASP programmer who must stay on top of the newest 
capabilities of ASP.NET, as well as for newcomers to this architecture who need an introduction to ASP.NET."
