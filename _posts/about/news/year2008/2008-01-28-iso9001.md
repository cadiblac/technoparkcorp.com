TechnoPark Corp., a custom software development company, specializes in web systems, VoIP
technologies, enterprise application integration, and data warehousing. Their outsourcing software
development services are specifically designed to be customer friendly, which is why certification
was so valuable to TechnoPark Corp.

"This is a very important event for us," says Arthur Petrenko, a marketing director for TechnoPark
Corp. While always maintaining the highest levels of self-enforced standards, TechnoPark Corp.
sought the ISO 9001:2000 certification in order to offer outside proof that their processes are of
the best quality to their clients.

For TechnoPark Corp., following the ISO standards means there is a verification of their internal
quality management systems. ISO 9001:2000 certification is specifically intended for organizations
that develop or provide services. In joining the ranks of other ISO certified entities throughout
the world, TechnoPark Corp. can guarantee that it has the systems and processes in place to meet the
needs of consumers and users.

TechnoPark Corp. achieved certification by working with Moody International, a global organization
specializing in leading their clients through the process of certification.
