TechnoPark Corp. have been an active user of Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the the last three years.
In our software solutions we're actively using Elastic Beanstalk, S3, EC2/EBS, CloudFront, and other
services of AWS. [s3auth.com](http://www.s3auth.com/) was one of the latest products developed and
made public by our team.

A few days ago we were qualified by AWS as a Standard Technology Partner. This new title makes
TechnoPark a reliable and trustable developer of your software projects.
