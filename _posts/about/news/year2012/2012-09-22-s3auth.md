We sponsored a small hosted service for owners of Amazon S3 buckets:
[s3auth.com](http://www.s3auth.com/). Amazon S3 doesn't provide an ability to deliver private
content through HTTP Basic/Digest authentication mechanisms. Our hosted service fills this gap.

The product already received good feedback from users worldwide. What is especially interesting is
that the web service is fully open source and hosted at
[github](https://github.com/yegor256/s3auth). The service itself, of course, is hosted at Amazon EC2.
