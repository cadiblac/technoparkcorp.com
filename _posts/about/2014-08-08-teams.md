For each new project we build and manage a dedicated distributed team of narrow-skilled technicians.
Each role in a project is being filled by the best suitable talent ([tell us about your
uniqueness](/contacts/sup) and we will invite you to one of our projects), the company or an individual.

The project team includes individuals and companies' engineers from different countries across the
globe. With our project management toolkit you interact with documents, project manager and the team
effectively and without redundant communications.


Our typical projects require system analysts, software architects, software designers, programmers,
test analysts, testers, technical/management reviewers, graphic artists, and system administators.
