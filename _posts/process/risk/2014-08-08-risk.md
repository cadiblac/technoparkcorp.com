A Risk in software development project is an event that may have an impact on the outcome of the
project. Risk differs from problems or issues because a risk refers to the future potential of
loss/benefit. Problems or issues, however, are conditions or states of affairs that exist in a
project at present time.

Risks should be identified for the following reasons:

 * [Schedule](/process/time/schedule) can be developed more realistically based on accurate Risk planning
 * [Budget](/process/cost/budget) is more accurate when it includes reservations for possible Risks
 * [Specification](/process/scope/specification) is unambiguous when Risks are revealed in advance
 * Outcomes are more predictable if the project team is prepared to handle unexpected negative interruptions

Risks are found and identified by the project team, project manager and you during the whole project
lifecycle. Risk management is an iterative process. The sooner a Risk is identified, the faster it
can be managed and mitigated.

Major Risk identification activities are performed during the [Inception
Phase](/process/time/inception). [Risk Strategies](/process/risk/strategy) and Risk response plans
are baselined on a [Risk List](/process/time/lco}">LCO Milestone
