"Information is an asset that, like other important business assets, is essential to an 
organization's business and consequently needs to be suitably protected. This is especially 
important in the increasingly interconnected business environment. As a result of this increasing 
interconnectivity, information is now exposed to a growing number and a wider variety of threats and 
vulnerabilities," states ISO/IEC 17799-2005 "Information Technology, Security Techniques, Code of 
Practice for Information Security Management".

As the standard defines, we protect information by means of:

 * Strict information security responsibilities
 * Confidential agreements with employees and partners
 * Background checks and screening of employees
 * Information security education
 * Physically secured perimeter and security areas
 * Configuration and change management procedures
 * Proactive capacity management
 * Controls against malicious code
 * User access control and monitoring
 * Cryptographic controls
 * Proactive incident management

Information we receive from our customers and data created during a project are labeled and stored 
in authorization-required databases and file systems. User access to such information is granted 
only by our director.
