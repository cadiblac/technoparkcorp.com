All software has [Defects](/process/quality/defect) due to the nature of the development process. 
Some defects are revealed during [testing](/process/quality/coq), some of them stay hidden until the 
end-users start to utilize the product.

In our projects, we do not try to reveal all Defects, since it's impossible and such intentions will 
lead to [Schedule](/process/time/schedule) and [Cost](/process/cost) overrun. We try to find as many 
Defects as possible during project lifecycle, so that the residual Defects do not block the project release.

All other Defects are removed during warranty defect removal period, after you identify and report them.

We guarantee that corrective actions are initiated for reported Defects within five business days.
