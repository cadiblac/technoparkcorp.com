Deliverables are what you pay for and what the project team produces. There is nothing more
important in a project than the Deliverables.

You receive the following:

 * Commented Source Code with unit-tests;
 * Compiled products (executables);
 * Specifications in original format ([SRS](/process/scope/srs), [Vision](/process/scope/vision))
 * User manual

Project documentation includes, but is not delivered under contract:

 * [Schedule](/process/time/schedule)
 * Software Architecture Document (SAD)
 * Test Plan (w/ Test Cases)
 * Software Development Plan (SDP)
 * [Iteration](/process/time/iteration) Plans
 * Meeting Protocols
 * [Traceability Matrix](/process/scope/matrix)
 * [Risk List](/process/risk/risklist)

You have an access to all project documentation, but we are
not contractually obliged to deliver it.
