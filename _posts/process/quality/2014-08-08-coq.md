[Quality](/process/quality) is what costs us money and what you pay for. Quality is measured as
amount of defect-free functionality related to defective functionality. Quality is measured in
percentages. Our contract says that 95% is acceptable Quality.

A [Defect](/process/quality/defect) is a non-conformity of
[Deliverables](/process/warranty/deliverables) to [Specification](/process/scope/specification). In
other words, the software product does not work as specified. Defects shall be revealed by the
project team before software product is delivered to you.

While you and end-users perceive Defects through software interfaces, the majority of Defects do not
reside in software itself. This is where Defects normally lie (in order of severity):
