Peer Review is a collaborative event in the project team when an engineer or specialist from another
team, author of the document, and project manager review certain project artifacts and identify [Defects](/process/quality/defect).

We perform Peer Reviews at least once per [Iteration](/process/time/iteration).

The benefits and advantages of Peer Reviews when compared to other methods of Defects revealing are:

 * High team morale and motivation
 * Improved [Quality](/process/quality) of document content
 * Early defect identification and removal
 * Glass-box testing of code
 * Commented and clear code
 * Optimized [quality cost](/process/quality/coq)

[SRS](/process/scope/srs), [Vision](/process/scope/vision), [Schedule](/process/time/schedule),
architecture, design, and software code are subject to Peer Reviews.
