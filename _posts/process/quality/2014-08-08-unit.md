Unit testing means that software includes special modules in automatic mode test, other modules, and
components. Unit tests play an adhesive role between software modules and
[Requirements](/process/scope/requirement). Unit tests guarantee that in any moment all software
modules work as they worked before, when the unit tests were created and executed.

We exploit this powerful technology in all projects, no matter what platform or programming language
is used. Unit testing gives a number of benefits to you:

 * Software is self-verifiable
 * A programmer change does not affect core refactoring
 * Code is stable and predictable
 * Software is scalable and supportable

While the technology is very useful for any project, it requires additional time for design and
development during early [Iterations](/process/time/iteration).
