[Incremental delivery](/process/communication/incremental) means that a software product is created,
[tested](/process/quality) and delivered to you in a number of builds. Each build has a new portion
of functionality. A new build is delivered by the end of each [Iteration](/process/time/iteration).

The Iteration Acceptance Meeting is an online meeting (20-40 minutes) where the project manager
presents Iteration results and explains them. You review the results, and confirm what new
functionality was accepted during Iteration (and what was not).

Typical agenda of Iteration Acceptance Meeting:

 * What was the plan for Iteration
 * What was completed and accepted by the customer
 * What failed and why
 * Current project [mitigation plans](/process/risk}"&gt;risks
