During the project execution, you communicate with project manager and project team by email, phone
or an instant messaging tool (Skype, YahooIM, MSN or GoogleTalk).

We work 5 days a week from Monday till Friday. The project manager is online from 6:00am-12:00pm EST
(6 hours daily).

Project communication language is English.
