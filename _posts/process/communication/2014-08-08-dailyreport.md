The Project manager reports to you on a daily basis by the conclusion of each [business
day](/process/communication/availability). No matter what was done during a day by the project team,
and what results were obtained, a Daily Report is sent by email to you.

The Daily Report includes:

 * List of activities completed
 * Project status (on track, behind schedule, etc.)
 * Hot list of Risks
 * Project performance metrics

This is an example of Daily Report:

John,

According to the Iteration Plan we committed, today
we've done the following (an aggregation of reports
I've received from team members and re-worked):

- SRS refined (R15-R22)
- SAD improved (DE1, DE5, DE8)
- Implemented: R10, R12
- Tested and Deployed: R3

The project is "on track" according to SPI (0.95).

Top risks still active:

- API may be delivered not in time
- .Net architect may be unavailable next week
- Lack of your feedback on Friday may delay
project release milestone

The closest Milestone is on 12-Jan (end of the day).

Liza Peterson, PM

Since we do [incremental delivery](/process/communication/incremental) of
[Deliverables](/process/warranty/deliverables), each Daily Report may include new functionality
implemented and tested. Your feedback on each Daily Report is expected and welcomed.
