[Schedule](/process/time/schedule) consists of Iterations. Each Iteration is a simple and atomic
piece of time spent on project activities by the project team.

The goal of Iteration is to perform all of the project disciplines and deliver the new product
increment - software with new functionality. Each Iteration conducts refinement on requirements,
architecture analysis and design, programming, testing, and deployment. Upon conclusion, the
Iteration finishes with new workable software build.

Normal Iteration duration is 10 working days. Sometimes we do smaller and longer Iterations.
Iteration starts with an Iteration Plan, which is a fine-grained plan, and includes:

 * Objective of Iteration
 * Work packages from Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
 * Roles and responsibilities
 * Activity list with cost and duration estimations
 * Network diagram
 * Bar chart (Gantt chart)

An Iteration Plan is created by the project manager and team. The Iteration Plan is then committed
by the project team - such commitment is a must for all Iterations.

An Iteration Acceptance Meeting finishes the Iteration and is conducted online with your
participation. The key purpose of this meeting is to present you the project status and risk
monitoring results. Earned Value technique is used to evaluate and indicate the project status. [CPI](/process/time/spi}">SPI
