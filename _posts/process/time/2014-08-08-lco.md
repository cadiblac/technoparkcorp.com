The Lifecycle Objectives (LCO) Milestone is a moment when the
[Specification](/process/scope/specification),
[Budget,](/process/cost/budget)
and the [Schedule](/process/time/schedule) are ready
and presented to you for approval.

At this point, you examine the Lifecycle Objectives of the project, and decide either
to proceed or to cancel it.

If the project is approved at this moment, we continue to work.

If project is not approved for any reason, project is closed and you pay only the
[Retainer](/process/cost/retainer)
for the work done on Specification development.
