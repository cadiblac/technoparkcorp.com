When a [ROM Estimate](/process/cost/rom) is approved and the project is started, the project team
has documentation that you provided to us - we call it an informal request (also called stakeholder
request in [RUP](http://www.ibm.com/rational)).

Your informal requests may include diagrams, specifications, spreadsheets, and other forms. All of
this information is very important to the project team. This information shall be converted to
[Specification](/process/scope/specification), as required by our process. This is the goal of the
Inception Phase - to convert your informal requests into very detailed and well-structured Specifications.

Inception Phase includes:

 * Refining the scope of the project
 * Project planning
 * Risk identification and analysis
 * Preparing the project environment
 * Estimating the [Budget](/process/cost)

The Inception Phase is finished when Specification, [Schedule](/process/time/schedule), [Budget](/process/risk}">Risks

<a href="${url:process/cost) are prepared and you reviewed them.     Approval of these documents means a green light for the continuation of the project.     The Inception Phase is finished     with an [LCO Milestone](/process/time/lco)."/>
