intro: "Review an example of a project Schedule"
description: |
  Schedule is a core time tracking/management document in the
  project, which collects together iterations, milestones and
  objectives. The document is kept current in our online
  project management system.

The Schedule is a coarse-grained project scenario, which splits the whole project into
[Iterations](/process/time/iteration). Each Iteration delivers a certain product functionality. The
Schedule is created during the [Inception Phase](/process/time/inception) and is approved on an [LCO Milestone](/process/time/lco).

The Schedule is kept current during the whole project. By having this document, you know when and
what results or functions to expect.

The Schedule is created by the project manager, right after you approve the
[Specification](/process/scope/specification). Together, all Iterations cover the whole project
scope as defined in the Specification. Overall, the Schedule is a central document in the project
[time management](/process/time).

We utilize the best practices of [Rational Unified Process (RUP)](http://www.ibm.com/rational) for
the product lifecycle. Thus, the key mandatory Milestones in each project are:

 * Lifecycle Objective (LCO) Milestone
 * Lifecycle Architecture (LCA) Milestone
 * Initial Operational Capability (IOC) Milestone
 * Release Milestone

The Schedule is developed by the project manager in our online management system and you approve it
with one click. The project moves on only when the Schedule had been approved.

This is an example of a Schedule:

<table>
        <tr>
            <th>#</th>
            <th>Objective</th>
            <th>Finish</th>
            <th>Staff-hours</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td/><td>Project start</td><td>28-Jan</td><td/></tr>
        <tr><td>I1</td><td>Inception Phase</td><td>8-Feb</td><td>130</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M1</td><td>Budget Approval (LCO Milestone)</td><td>8-Feb</td><td/></tr>
        <tr><td>I2</td><td>Prototype (R1, R5, R9)</td><td>22-Feb</td><td>240</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M2</td><td>Architecture Baselined (LCA Milestone)</td><td>8-Feb</td><td/></tr>
        <tr><td>I2</td><td>R1, R3, R4, R8</td><td>22-Feb</td><td>240</td></tr>
        <tr><td>I3</td><td>R2, R5, R9</td><td>4-Mar</td><td>225</td></tr>
        <tr><td>I4</td><td>R6, R7, R10</td><td>18-Mar</td><td>310</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M3</td><td>Product Readiness (IOC Milestone)</td><td>18-Mar</td><td/></tr>
        <tr><td>I5</td><td>Transition Phase</td><td>3-Apr</td><td>180</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M4</td><td>Project finished (Release Milestone)</td><td>3-Apr</td><td/></tr>
    </table>

The Schedule is tracked with a [Schedule Performance Index (SPI)](/process/time/spi), which shows
you and the project team what progress has been made. The SPI is presented to you on each Iteration
Acceptance Meeting.
