We only work with fixed-price contracts. Staff-hours are used to calculate the price. The
[Budget](/process/cost/budget) is the amount of required staff-hours multiplied by the price of one staff-hour.

The price per staff-hour includes direct expenses, indirect expenses, and our profit. Depending on
the size of the project and cost of technical specialists' efforts price per hour may vary in
interval between $25 and $60.

Direct expenses include:

 * Expenses for technicians/suppliers;
 * Salary and bonuses of project manager;
 * Our expenses for project management software development;
 * Equipment rental;
 * Local and state taxes.

Indirect expenses include:

 * Corporate QA services;
 * Process improvement;
 * Free defect removal services;
 * Mistakes in estimates that may result in project cost overrun;
 * Management reserve.

You approve a Budget as the fixed amount of staff-hours and monetary value required to complete the
project. The Budget is never changed if scope of the work is not changed.
