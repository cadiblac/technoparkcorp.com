We calculate, communicate and define the Budget in [staff-hours](/process/cost/prices). The actual 
monetary size of a project is a multiple of staff-hours and price per hour.

We use our proprietary patent-pending method (USPTO patent 12/193,010) for Budget estimation and calculation.

The Budget covers all costs, including:

 * Programming
 * [Requirements Development](/process/scope)
 * Project Management
 * Architecture and Design
 * [Testing](/process/quality) and Quality Assurance
 * Deployment
 * [Defect-removal](/process/warranty/defectremoval)

The Budget is paid only for [Deliverables](/process/warranty/deliverables), not for the time spent. 
It does not include [maintenance](/process/warranty/support}">support

and other
