Payments are done according to an approved [Schedule](/process/time/schedule). Each payment is
connected to a certain Milestone, and is paid when all of the acceptance criteria is met by the
project team.

What is important for the project is to keep total amount of payments received higher than actual
project cost, as total amount of staff-hours paid for task executors. This diagram shows the dynamic
nature of project payments:

You will make payments (P, P, P and P) in order to cover actual cost of the project, but strictly
according to the approved Schedule document with a list of Milestones (M, M, and M)

We accept different payment options: cashier checks, wire transfers to US bank account, credit cards
([Visa](http://www.visa.com), [MasterCard](http://www.mastercard.com), [AmEx](http://www.americanexpress.com)).
