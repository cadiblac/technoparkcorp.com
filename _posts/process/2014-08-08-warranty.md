As stated in our software development contract, a software project is closed when
[Quality](/process/quality) is acceptable. That means that 95% of functional
[Requirements](/process/scope/requirement)
from [SRS](/process/scope/srs) do not
have any [Defects](/process/quality/defect).

Since 100% Quality is not attainable, [Deliverables](/process/warranty/deliverables) have many more
Defects than you or our testers can reveal in a limited amount of [time](/process/time). Project
acceptance criteria is a situation when Deliverables do not have critical Defects that
block product release.

We provide defect removal service free of charge during one calendar year
after project completion. Such service includes removal of any Defects you find
in Deliverables.

There is a difference between Defect removal and [support services](/process/warranty/support).
We do not provide [support services](/process/warranty/support), which include
server administration, end-user support, search engine optimization, etc.
