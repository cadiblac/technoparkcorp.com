Software development is very tightly connected with intellectual property that is created, managed,
and transferred during project execution. We pay serious attention to such property, whether it is
owned by you or by us.

A [Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)](/process/ipr/nda) is signed prior to any communication on the
software project. The NDA states that any confidential information disclosed by you is to be
protected and we have no rights of republishing or redistributing any such information.

Software development contracts limit our ability to transfer or disclose intellectual property
created during project execution. We are incorporated in the United States and work according to
[Copyright Law of the United States of America](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/) - our services
are titled in the contract as ["work made for hire"](/process/ipr/law).

We protect Confidential Information in our offices and servers by means of a strict internal
[Information Security Policy](/process/ipr/security) designed in compliance with ISO 27001.
