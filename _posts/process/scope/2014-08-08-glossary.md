There are hundreds of [Requirements](/process/scope/requirement) in mid-size and small software
products. All Requirements are defined in a textual format based on the terms from the Glossary. A
Glossary is used in order to avoid misinterpretation of key terms and definitions inside the [Specification](/process/scope/specification).

Key terms, data units, and concepts are taken from Requirements and entered in the Glossary. This is
a proven method to avoid ambiguity.

Consider the following example of two simple functional requirements:

<table>
        <tr>
            <th style="width: 30px;">#</th>
            <th>Requirement</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>R1</td><td>User can send a [Request] for new account registration,
        System shall validate provided information and create a new [Account] for the user.</td></tr>

        <tr><td>R2</td><td>User can send a [Request] for [Password] change in
        their [Account], System shall change database records
        for the user.</td></tr>
    </table>

The following is an example of the Glossary terms for the Requirements shown above:

<table>
        <tr>
            <th style="width: 60px;">Term</th>
            <th>Definition</th>
            <th style="width: 60px;">Used in</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td>[Request]</td><td>
        Web form completion and submission operation performed
        by the user. Process is completed when the 'Submit' button is clicked.
        </td>
        <td>R1, R2</td></tr>

        <tr><td>[Password]</td><td>6-20 characters connected with the user account.  It
        must contain at least one numeric symbol and one capital letter.</td>
        <td>R2</td></tr>

        <tr><td>[Account]</td><td>Database record associated with the user,
        includes: Login, Password, Name, Phone, and Email.</td>
        <td>R1, R2</td></tr>
    </table>

As evidenced by the example, the Glossary helps to define shared concepts of the system scope and
work with it independently of the Requirements.

A Glossary is created for all projects, regardless of the project size. The Glossary is a section of
the [SRS](/process/scope/srs).
