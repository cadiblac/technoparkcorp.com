As soon as Functional [Requirements](/process/scope/requirement) are specified in the 
[SRS](/process/scope/srs) and you approved them, they are listed in a Traceability Matrix. Design 
Elements, [Risks](/process/risk/risk), [Features](/process/scope/feature), and test cases are traced 
to Functional Requirements and vise versa.

Bi-directional traceability between key elements of project scope (artifacts) gives a number of 
benefits to the project:

 * Synchronization of different roles efforts
 * Supportability of the whole product
 * Ability to backtrack and look at features or business needs
 * Status reporting and analysis

The Traceability Matrix is a very powerful instrument of [time](/process/time), [scope management](/process/cost}">cost
