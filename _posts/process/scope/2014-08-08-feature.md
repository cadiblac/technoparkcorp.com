A system boundary is defined by [Requirements](/process/scope/requirement). A Feature is a type of
high-level user Requirement that explains what the user wants to do with the system in order to
satisfy their needs.

A Feature describes what the user can do with the system. Features are listed in the [Vision](/process/scope/vision).

Examples of Features include:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th style="width: 50px;">#</th>
        <th>Feature</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>FEAT1</td><td>User can manage their account, edit settings, upload photos, and exchange messages with other users.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FEAT2</td><td>Administrator can manage users, view reports, print reports, send reports by email, and configure reporting system.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>FEAT3</td><td>Affiliate can access system database reports via XML, obtain the latest user data or statistics, and payout reports.</td></tr>
</table>

The key difference between a Feature and a Functional Requirement is that the Feature is a
non-formal statement. A Feature resembles a wide and uncertain definition of functionality, while a
Functional Requirement resembles a strict and unambiguous formula.

Each Functional Requirement is traced back to a Feature in the [Traceability Matrix](/process/scope/matrix).
