A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is one of the central artifacts in the course
of a software development project. It defines what shall be developed in great detail. The SRS is a
rather technical document and usualy requires your significant attention to read and understand it.

The SRS is a format of the [Specification](/process/scope/specification). The SRS is based on the
[Vision](/process/scope/vision) and provides details for each [Feature](/process/scope/feature) from it.

The SRS is created by a system analyst according to details provided by the requirements specifier
(your representative). The SRS includes four sections:

 * [Glossary](/process/scope/glossary)
 * Use Cases
 * Functional [Requirements](/process/scope/requirement)
 * Non-Functional Requirements

'Recommended Practices for Software Requirements Specifications' is used to structure, define and
maintain the SRS.

The amount of effort contributed to SRS development and maintenance depends on the project size and
complexity. However, average numbers (in correlation with the project
[Budget](/process/cost/budget)) are as follows:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Budget, staff-hours</th>
        <th>Functional Requirements</th>
        <th>SRS size, pages</th>
        <th>Efforts, staff-hours</th>
        <th>Time, weeks</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>1000-2200</td><td>40-130</td><td>20-60</td><td>150-280</td><td>3-5</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1900-3500</td><td>100-400</td><td>40-100</td><td>200-400</td><td>4-7</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3000-5000</td><td>350-700</td><td>80-200</td><td>350-700</td><td>5-9</td></tr>
</table>

Functional Requirements for the SRS are uniquely identified and used in a [Traceability
Matrix](/process/scope/matrix) in order to provide backward traceability for Features.
