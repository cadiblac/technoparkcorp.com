We implement full-scale PMBOK-inspired project management and make its every last detail valuable 
and easy-to-understand by means of instant automated metrics. Complex project management principles, 
documents, processes and rules are transparent for you with our project management web panel.

Our software development lifecycle is iterative and incremental. We deliver software product by 
independent builds at the end of each [Iteration](/process/time/iteration). You approve 
[Schedule](/process/time/schedule) at the [LCO milestone](/process/time/lco) in the first weeks of a 
project, and then track it by [Earned Value](/process/time/spi) data.

The diagram shows how your informal request is transferred to Deliverables, which you accept at the 
end of the project:

Project [communications](/process/communication) are iterative and customer-focused. They include 
[Daily Reports](/process/communication/dailyreport), [incremental 
delivery](/process/communication/incremental) of software product, regular [acceptance 
meetings](/process/communication/iam) with project status reporting and monitoring.

We proactively protect [intellectual property rights](/process/ipr) of software by means of 
[Non-Disclosure Agreements](/process/ipr/nda) and [information security](/process/ipr/security) 
internal policies and rules.

When a project is closed, we continue to provide warranty [defect 
removal](/process/warranty/defectremoval) services for [Deliverables](/process/warranty/deliverables).
