title: "Iterative And Incremental Software Development Process"
intro: "Learn about our key project management processes"
description: |
  Iterative and incremental process delivers full-scale
  project management methods and principles to your agile
  project, without bureaucracy and burden. We make the project
  management simple and easy-to-use by means of our automated
  instant metrics.

We implement full-scale PMBOK-inspired project management and make its every last detail valuable
and easy-to-understand by means of instant automated metrics. Complex project management principles,
documents, processes and rules are transparent for you with our project management web panel.

Our software development lifecycle is iterative and incremental. We deliver software product by
independent builds at the end of each [Iteration](/process/time/iteration). You approve
[Schedule](/process/time/schedule) at the [LCO milestone](/process/time/lco) in the first weeks of a
project, and then track it by [Earned Value](/process/time/spi) data.

The diagram shows how your informal request is transferred to Deliverables, which you accept at the
end of the project:

\begin{tikzpicture}
    [node distance = 2.5cm,
    auto, thick]

    \node [cloud, draw=tpcRed, cloud ignores aspect, fill=tpcRed!40] (request) {Informal Request};
    \node [block, below=0.8cm of request] (vision) {Vision};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of vision] (rom) {ROM Estimate};
        \node [block, below=0.5cm of rom.south east] (retainer) {Retainer};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of rom] (scheduleEstimate) {Schedule Estimate};
    \node [draw=tpcBlue, dashed, fit=(vision) (rom) (retainer) (scheduleEstimate)] (inception) {};

    \node [block, below=2.8cm of vision] (srs) {SRS};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of srs] (budget) {Budget};

    \node [choice, text width=2cm, below=2.5cm of srs] (lco) {LCO Milestone};

    \node [block, below=1.5cm of lco] (deliverables) {Deliverables};
    \node [block, below of=deliverables] (accepted) {Accepted Specification};

    \path [line] (request) -- (vision);
    \path [line] (vision) -- node [near end] {Requirements analysis and specification} (srs);
    \path [line] (srs) -- (lco);
    \path [line] (lco) -- node [right, text width=6cm] {Analysis, design, programming, testing and deployment} (deliverables);
    \path [line] (deliverables) -- node [right] {User Acceptance Testing} (accepted);

Project [communications](/process/communication) are iterative and customer-focused. They include
[Daily Reports](/process/communication/dailyreport), [incremental
delivery](/process/communication/incremental) of software product, regular [acceptance
meetings](/process/communication/iam) with project status reporting and monitoring.

We proactively protect [intellectual property rights](/process/ipr) of software by means of
[Non-Disclosure Agreements](/process/ipr/nda) and [information security](/process/ipr/security)
internal policies and rules.

When a project is closed, we continue to provide warranty [defect
removal](/process/warranty/defectremoval) services for [Deliverables](/process/warranty/deliverables).
