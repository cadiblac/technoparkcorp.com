The development of started in July 2009, when an open source PHP framework
([FaZend Framework](http://code.google.com/p/fazend/)) was created and hosted at Google Code. The FaZend
Framework was designed on top of [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com), a very famous
open-source web development toolkit, in order to make it more suitable for continuously delivered
web systems.

FaZend Framework proved its success with a number of open source and commercial web products. At the
end of 2009 a group of engineers managed by our staff started the development of
[fazend.com](http://www.fazend.com), a free hosted solution for continuous integration of PHP, Java,
Python, and Ruby projects (this list is not exhaustive).

Nowadays this platform is unique in its class because it combines together the service of private
Subversion repository, Trac environment and continuous integration environment. The development is
still in progress, but we already identify a significant success with this endeavor.
