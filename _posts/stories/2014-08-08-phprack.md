The design and development of took almost 3 months for a team of 5 people, working in parallel and
absolutely distributed (they never met each other face-to-face and never communicated online). There
were engineers from Poland, Belarus, Czech Republic, and United States. The team communicated only
through Trac and Subversion, using [FaZend.com](http://www.fazend.com) Continuous Integration platform.

The product is developed in PHP, with an extensive use of XML and JavaScript. We've used a number of
frameworks and third-party tools, like PHPUnit, jQuery, JSLint, QUnit, Phing.

The biggest challenge in the project was a necessity to invent the product, design it and develop at
the same time. There were a number of risks related to this challenge. What helped us to mitigate
the majority of risks is a [Puzzle Driven Development](/innovations/pdd) concept, which was invented
during that time and applied for USPTO patent. The project helped us to invent the PDD concept and
to prove its effectiveness in a distributed team doing parallel programming.
