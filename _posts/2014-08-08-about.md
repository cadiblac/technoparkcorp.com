TechnoPark Corp. is a software development with an innovative approach to project management in
[distributed software development teams](/about/teams). Like nowhere else, when you hire us as a
general contractor you stay actively involved in every last detail of a project internal affairs.
You control your business success by means of our automated instant metrics, compliant with
[PMBOK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project\_Management\_Body\_of\_Knowledge),
[CMMI](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/cmmi/general/),
[RUP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM\_Rational\_Unified\_Process) and [ISO 9001](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_9001).

We work only with fixed-price projects, where [Scope](/process/scope), [Cost](/process/cost) and
[Schedule](/process/time) are always baselined. You do not pay salaries or any other indirect costs,
only a fixed price of [Deliverables](/process/warranty/deliverables).

A project is organized as a [distributed team](/about/teams) of narrow-skilled engineers when you
can pick-up the best suitable talents through just one contractor. There are 70+ professional
software groups and individuals in our database who can be involved in your project.

You provide functional and non-functional requirements. We gather a project team and equip it with
our proprietary online project management system. Technicians provide programming, testing, design
and analysis services. Our project manager integrates all these efforts together in order to deliver
a product to your end-users.
