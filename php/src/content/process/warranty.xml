    <p>As stated in our software development contract, a software project is closed when
    <a href="${url:process/quality}">Quality</a> is acceptable. That means that 95% of functional 
    <a href="${url:process/scope/requirement}">Requirements</a> from <a href="${url:process/scope/srs}">SRS</a> do not
    have any <a href="${url:process/quality/defect}">Defects</a>.</p>

    <p>Since 100% Quality is not attainable, <a href="${url:process/warranty/deliverables}">Deliverables</a> have many more
    Defects than you or our testers can reveal in a limited amount of <a href="${url:process/time}">time</a>. Project
    acceptance criteria is a situation when Deliverables do not have critical Defects that
    block product release.</p>

    <p>We provide defect removal service free of charge during one calendar year
    after project completion. Such service includes removal of any Defects you find
    in Deliverables.</p>

    <p>There is a difference between Defect removal and <a href="${url:process/warranty/support}">support services</a>.  
    We do not provide <a href="${url:process/warranty/support}">support services</a>, which include
    server administration, end-user support, search engine optimization, etc.</p>
