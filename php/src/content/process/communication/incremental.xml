    Incremental delivery of software means that software product is specified, designed,
    implemented, tested and deployed in a number of builds. Each build has a new portion of
    functionality. All builds together constitute the project scope.

    <p>Incremental delivery of software means that software product is specified, designed,
    implemented, tested and deployed in a number of builds. Each build has a new portion of
    functionality. All builds together constitute the project <a href="${url:process/scope}">scope</a>.</p>

    <p>Consider the example development steps in a sample software project. 
    Project statement is:</p>

<pre>
System is an online database management tool where 
end-users can find information about real estate 
objects and post new ads.
</pre>

    <p>This is a list of <a href="${url:process/scope/requirement}">functional requirements</a> 
    in the <a href="${url:process/scope/srs}">SRS</a>:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>#</th>
            <th>Requirement</th>
            <th>Build</th>
            <th>Status</th>
        </tr>

        <tr><td>R1</td><td>End-user can initiate search by keyword, System shall display search result</td><td>#2</td><td>accepted</td></tr>
        <tr><td>R2</td><td>End-user can post a new ad, System shall validate information and include new ad into database</td><td>#2</td><td>accepted</td></tr>
        <tr><td>R3</td><td>End-user can scroll search result in paging mode, System shall display different pages with search result</td><td>#3</td><td>accepted</td></tr>
        <tr><td>R4</td><td>Administrator can list users and block any, System shall display user list and delete selected users</td><td>#3</td><td>tested</td></tr>
        <tr><td>R4.1</td><td>Administrator can sort list of users, System shall sort according to selected sorting criteria</td><td>#3</td><td>implemented</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>This is an example of the <a href="${url:process/time/schedule}">Schedule</a> for the sample project:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>#</th>
            <th>Objective</th>
            <th>Finish</th>
            <th>Staff-hours</th>
        </tr>
        <tr><td></td><td>Project start</td><td>28-Jan</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>1</td><td>Inception Phase</td><td>8-Feb</td><td>120</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M</td><td>Budget Approval (LCO Milestone)</td><td>8-Feb</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>2</td><td>R1, R2</td><td>22-Feb</td><td>180</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3</td><td>R3, R4, R4.1</td><td>4-Mar</td><td>260</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M</td><td>Product Readiness (IOC Milestone)</td><td>18-Mar</td><td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>4</td><td>Transition Phase</td><td>3-Apr</td><td>140</td></tr>
        <tr><td>M</td><td>Project finished (Release Milestone)</td><td>3-Apr</td><td></td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>Imagine that the project is in <a href="${url:process/time/iteration}">Iteration</a> #3 
    and right now the project team is
    performing user acceptance testing with you for build #3.</p>

    <p>The example illustrates that each new Iteration gives you a new workable
    product, and serves as an extension to the previous build.</p>
