    <p>The Project manager reports to you on a daily basis by the conclusion of each 
    <a href="${url:process/communication/availability}">business day</a>. No matter what was done
    during a day by the project team, and what results were obtained, a
    Daily Report is sent by email to you.</p>    

    <p>The Daily Report includes:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>List of activities completed</li>
    <li>Project status (on track, behind schedule, etc.)</li>
    <li>Hot list of Risks</li>
    <li>Project performance metrics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is an example of Daily Report:</p>

<pre>
John,

According to the Iteration Plan we committed, today
we've done the following (an aggregation of reports 
I've received from team members and re-worked):

- SRS refined (R15-R22)
- SAD improved (DE1, DE5, DE8)
- Implemented: R10, R12
- Tested and Deployed: R3

The project is "on track" according to SPI (0.95).

Top risks still active:

- API may be delivered not in time
- .Net architect may be unavailable next week
- Lack of your feedback on Friday may delay
project release milestone

The closest Milestone is on 12-Jan (end of the day).

Liza Peterson, PM

    <p>Since we do <a href="${url:process/communication/incremental}">incremental delivery</a> 
    of <a href="${url:process/warranty/deliverables}">Deliverables</a>, 
    each Daily Report may include
    new functionality implemented and tested. 
    Your feedback on each Daily Report is expected and welcomed.</p>
