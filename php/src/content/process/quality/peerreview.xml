    <p>Peer Review is a collaborative event in the project team when an engineer or specialist
    from another team, author of the document, and project manager review certain 
    project artifacts and identify <a href="${url:process/quality/defect}">Defects</a>.</p>

    <p>We perform Peer Reviews at least once per <a href="${url:process/time/iteration}">Iteration</a>.</p>

    <p>The benefits and advantages of Peer Reviews when compared to other methods
    of Defects revealing are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>High team morale and motivation</li>
        <li>Improved <a href="${url:process/quality}">Quality</a> of document content</li>
        <li>Early defect identification and removal</li>
        <li>Glass-box testing of code</li>
        <li>Commented and clear code</li>
        <li>Optimized <a href="${url:process/quality/coq}">quality cost</a></li>
    </ul>
