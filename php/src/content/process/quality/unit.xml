	<p>Unit testing means that software includes special modules in automatic
	mode test, other modules, and components. Unit tests play an adhesive role between
	software modules and <a href="${url:process/scope/requirement}">Requirements</a>. Unit tests guarantee that in any moment
	all software modules work as they worked before, when the unit tests were created and executed.</p>

	<p>We exploit this powerful technology in all projects, no matter what platform or
	programming language is used. Unit testing gives a number of benefits to you:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Software is self-verifiable</li>
		<li>A programmer change does not affect core refactoring</li>
		<li>Code is stable and predictable</li>
		<li>Software is scalable and supportable</li>
	</ul>

	<p>While the technology is very useful for any project, it requires additional
	time for design and development during early <a href="${url:process/time/iteration}">Iterations</a>.</p>
