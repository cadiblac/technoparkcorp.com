    each other.

    <p>As soon as Functional <a href="${url:process/scope/requirement}">Requirements</a> are specified in the
    <a href="${url:process/scope/srs}">SRS</a> and you approved them,
    they are listed in a Traceability Matrix. 
    Design Elements, <a href="${url:process/risk/risk}">Risks</a>, 
    <a href="${url:process/scope/feature}">Features</a>, and test cases are traced to Functional
    Requirements and vise versa.</p> 
    
    <p>Bi-directional traceability between key elements of project scope (artifacts) gives
    a number of benefits to the project:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Synchronization of different roles efforts</li>
        <li>Supportability of the whole product</li>
        <li>Ability to backtrack and look at features or business needs</li>
        <li>Status reporting and analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Traceability Matrix is a very powerful instrument of <a href="${url:process/time}">time</a>, 
    <a href="${url:process/cost}">cost</a> and <a href="${url:process/scope}">scope management</a>.</p>
