    <p>All software has <a href="${url:process/quality/defect}">Defects</a> due to the nature of the development process. Some defects
    are revealed during <a href="${url:process/quality/coq}">testing</a>, some of them stay hidden until the end-users start
    to utilize the product.</p>

    <p>In our projects, we do not try to reveal all Defects, since it's impossible and such 
    intentions will lead to <a href="${url:process/time/schedule}">Schedule</a> and 
    <a href="${url:process/cost}">Cost</a> overrun. We try to find as many Defects as
    possible during project lifecycle, so that the residual Defects do not block the project
    release.</p>    

    <p>All other Defects are removed during warranty defect removal period, after
    you identify and report them.</p>

    <p>We guarantee that corrective actions are initiated for reported Defects within 
    five business days.</p>
