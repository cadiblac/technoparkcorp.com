    <p>We work only with fixed-price projects, where 
    <a href="${url:process/scope}">Scope</a>, 
    <a href="${url:process/cost}">Cost</a> and 
    <a href="${url:process/time}">Schedule</a> are always baselined.
    You do not pay salaries or any other indirect costs, only a fixed price of 
    <a href="${url:process/warranty/deliverables}">Deliverables</a>.</p>
    
    <p>A project is organized as a <a href="${url:about/teams}">virtual team</a> of narrow-skilled
    engineers when you can pick-up the best suitable talents through
    just one contractor - us. There are 70+ professional software
    groups and individuals in our database who could be involved to your project.</p>

    <p>You provide functional and non-functional requirements. 
    We gather a project team and equip it with our proprietary 
    online project management system. Technicians provide programming,
    testing, design and analysis services. Our project manager integrates
    all these efforts together in order to deliver a product to your end-users.</p>
