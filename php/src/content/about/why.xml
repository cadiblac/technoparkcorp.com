    <p>Successful selection of a reliable contractor is not a success guarantee in
    a particular project. Even when the contractor conducts proper
    project management you want to be an informed stakeholder
    and want to get a clear picture of project performance.
    Nowadays it is difficult to get such cumulative and honest picture 
    without personal intrusion into management process, compromising and 
    interrupting the work. On the other hand, lack or delay in such report
    leads to missed deadlines, cost overrun and business failure.</p>
    
    <p>In our projects we implement full-scale project management and make its
    every last detail valuable and easy-to-understand
    by means of instant automated metrics. You become a real stakeholder, 
    working together with the remote team and getting that clear picture
    by means of instant automated metrics. Other reasons:</p>
    
    <ul>
