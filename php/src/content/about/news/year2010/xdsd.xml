    TechnoPark Corp. took a participation in inventing and development
    of a new open methodology called
    eXtremely Distributed Software Development (XDSD). Now we are
    proposing its proprietary implementation to our first pilot
    clients.

    <p>
        <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>
        is a collection of principles of software development
        widely used in open source world, but very rarely applied
        to commercial projects. When these ground rules (there are
        four) are properly implemented in a project they guarantee
        higher quality of code and significantly reduce risks of failure.
    </p>

    <p>
        The XDSD principles are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Everyone gets paid for verified deliverables</li>
        <li>Defects are planned and don't block delivery</li>
        <li>Quality-of-code metrics are CI gate conditions</li>
        <li>VCS commits to <tt>trunk</tt> are prohibited</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        A successful implementation of <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> in any particular project
        requires an existence of certain tools, technologies,
        and skills, which typical project teams rarely, if ever, possess.
        Institutionalization of these four rules in a software development team
        is a task of high complexity, and will affect
        almost all aspects of business and social life of its members.
    </p>

        Email us to get a white paper about <a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a> and its proprietary
        implementation provided by TechnoPark Corp.
