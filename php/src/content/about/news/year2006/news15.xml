<title>TechnoPark Corp. Visited SEC(R) 2006</title>

<description>On November 16 - 17, Software Engineering Conference (Russia),
 or SEC(R), the conference devoted to Information Technology and Software
 Engineering, took place in Moscow. TechnoPark Corp.'s management has
 attended the event.</description>

<text>

<p>This year SEC(R)'s audience gathered companies from eastern and western 
Europe, with the majority of attendees from CIS countries. <ahref 
name="http://secr.ru/2006/">SEC(R) 2006</ahref> offered keynote talks by
leaders in the field, invited presentations along specialized themes, 
workshops, round table discussions and presentations of technical papers on 
software research, the cutting edge of practice, and new developments in 
software engineering.</p>

<p>The 2006 conference was focused on provision of business value by 
differentiating from their competitors in a myriad of ways. The reports 
covered Technology and Technology Solutions and Human Aspects in Software 
Engineering. Process Management, Project Management and QA Management became 
the most burning issues at the conference.</p>

<p>Next year, TechnoPark Corp. will not only participate in SEC(R) as 
an attendee, but also make a presentation. </p>
