<title>Mobile Credit Card Processing System is Developed</title>

<description>Mobile credit card payment processing system was developed by 
TechnoPark Corp. The system will be deployed in Europe this summer.
</description>

<text>

<p>The system's main idea is to connect mobile phones with credit cards. 
It means that upon proper credit card verification, the sole mobile phone 
can be used for payments. The new mobile payment processing system will process 
transactions using the existing commercial accounts and processing networks. 
This feature makes the system stands out among other mobile payment systems. </p>

<p>TechnoPark Corp.'s mobile payment processing system is intended to 
increase security of transactions by excluding both banking operations within 
the system and the necessity to provide sellers with a buyer's credit card 
information. </p>  

<p>Every user will have their own mobile account. The specific mobile application 
which is to be pre-installed or downloaded to user's mobile phone will be 
connected to the user's credit card and a password. The data is never 
transferred via open channels. All the information is transferred to server 
only via GPRS and 128 bit SSL encryption.</p>   

<p>The Java2ME mobile software is easy to install and use. It is based on 
Java2SE, XML and Oracle technologies.</p>
