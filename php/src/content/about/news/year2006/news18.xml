<title>Outsourcing IT Projects to Ukraine: What to Expect?</title>

<description>Risky or profitable - which of the two characteristics outweighs 
in outsourcing to the Ukraine? The Ukrainian Outsourcing Forum (UOF) 2006 has uncovered 
the most burning questions in order to find the right answers.</description>

<text>

<p>While eastern Europe gathers speed as venue for IT outsourcing, the Ukraine is 
becoming an important industry's player. The country's outsourcing turnover 
grows by 200-300% annually. Progressively more foreign customers choose to 
outsource their IT projects to Ukrainian companies. Still, both customers and 
outsourcing service providers realize that a number of problems are to be 
solved.  At UOF - one of the most important outsourcing events in eastern 
Europe - the most burning problems were uncovered and discussed. Ukrainian 
outsourcing company TechnoPark Corp. made a presentation on the most urgent 
problems and suggested possible solutions. </p>

<p><b>Decentralization of Outsourcing Industry</b>
<br />UOF 2006 showed that the Ukraine tends to contribute to the decentralization of outsourcing 
industry. One of the Forum's sections was devoted to regional outsourcing 
companies. Along with the country's capital, Kyiv, there are some powerful 
outsourcing regions in Ukraine: Kharkov Region, Odessa Region, Donetsk Region 
and Dnepropetrovsk Region. Representatives of regional companies as well as 
customers discussed the problems and potential of IT outsourcing in these 
locations.</p>

<p>TechnoPark Corp.'s presentation, devoted to integration of customer-driven 
model, became the core of the section and provoked a heated dispute. So, here 
are some ideas on outsourcing IT projects to Ukrainian regional companies based 
on the report presented by TechnoPark Corp. - IT Outsourcing Company based in 
Dnepropetrovsk. </p>

<p>First of all, who are the actors of Ukrainian regional outsourcing market?  
In each outsourcing region, 10-50 software companies operate. There are no big 
companies. The average staff is 50-100 employees with only a few companies 
employing 100+ personnel. Naturally, there are no big customers. Traditionally, 
medium and small businesses outsource their projects to regional companies. 
Obviously, most regions are far below their potential yet. The figures show 
that there are 6 high schools and 3 IT-education companies providing about 1500 
graduates annually in Dnepropetrovsk. The figures are similar for most 
outsourcing regions of the country.   </p>

<p><b>Process</b>
<br />"Availability of high-class programmers doesn't assure high quality of 
project implementation. Well-organized process is what every company needs for 
success," says Anna Stetsenko, HR Director at TechnoPark Corp. By way of 
discussion all participants agreed that organization, planning and phasing are 
vital for offshore IT outsourcing.</p>

<p>Anna Stetsenko spoke about the TechnoPark Corp's experience: "This year we 
have implemented RUP-based development process. With RUP we are on the same 
wavelength with our foreign customers and they are happy to understand our 
process." </p>

<p>According to TechnoPark Corp., good process includes communication skills 
(language skills and business etiquette), culture of collaborative work, 
dissociation of roles within a project, good modeling skills and quality 
assurance. "We are working over each of the issues. Still all of us have a lot 
of things to do. Now it is easier for us as we see the goal and see the 
hurdles," Anna Stetsenko adds up. </p>

<p>Process has long been a problem for most Eastern European companies. The UOF 
2006 indicated the positive shift: Ukraine starts to employ the world-
recognized practices and methodologies thus becoming more attractive for 
customers.  </p>

<p><b>Customer-Driven Model</b>
<br />Customer-oriented model is probably the only way for regional companies 
to compete with big Kyiv outsourcing service providers having greater staffs 
and marketing opportunities. TechnoPark Corp. presented their ideas about 
customer-driven process.</p>

<p>Customers' expectations are mainly about quality: quality of process, 
quality of relationship, quality of deliverables and quality of price.  
According to the presentation, focusing on these issues must be the main 
target of regional companies while working over projects.</p> 

<p>Some practices which have been successfully implemented by some Ukrainian 
companies were highlighted during the discussion: the establishment of local 
policy and standards either within a company or within the whole region; 
internal testing and certification; training for employees; corporate culture. 
</p>

<p>Along with the development process, customers are interested in pricing. Budgets for 
outsourcing projects in the Ukraine are much lower than those in India, China, 
Russia and other outsourcing leaders. Recently, head-hunting was on the verge 
of drawing a price increase. In order to lure high-class engineers away, 
companies had to offer higher salaries. Thus, the thread of increase of project 
costs occurred. UOF 2006 assured that customers have nothing to worry about. 
</p>  

<p>The idea of creating a HR Ethics Code in order to fight off unfair HR 
activities was accepted enthusiastically. Forum participants believe that it 
will help to keep prices down and assure stability of company operations.  
</p>

<p><b>Ultimately</b>
<br />The Ukraine is no more a dark horse for global outsourcing industry. Since 
2000 when the first pilgrims had tried Ukrainian software development services 
- and some failed, companies have gained much experience in both project 
implementation and customer relationships.</p>

<p>Because of the lack of companies with large staff, the Ukraine is not a country 
for time-consuming projects. Instead, due to powerful intellectual potential 
the country is focused on small and medium-size R&amp;D projects.</p>

<p>Customers should pay attention to the Ukrainian regional IT outsourcing 
companies which go overboard to attract business.  They have a good chance of becoming
competitive players in the near future as long as they offer low 
prices and high quality deliverables. </p>
