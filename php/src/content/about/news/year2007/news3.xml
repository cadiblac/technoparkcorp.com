 MySellerSpace.com. The web site was developed to provide an online platform
  for selling things online.</description>

 community to offer their items for sale through Seller Space Widgets. Users
  can create a widget for each item for sale in their profile. The number
   of widgets per profile is unlimited. </p>

<p>Sale items are categorized and can be searched by name, category, price
 diapason and other parameters. All the widgets created within MySellerSpace
  are also placed on other seller networks.</p>
