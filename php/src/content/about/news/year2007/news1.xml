<title>A New Website for the Concord Group Corporation Just Released</title>     

<description>TechnoPark Corp. recently completed website development for
 the Concord Group</description>

 <text>
<p>A Russian-English bilingual website for the Concord Group is now
 live at <ahref name="http://concordgroup.com.ua">http://concordgroup.com.ua
 </ahref>.</p>

<p>Developed by TechnoPark Corp., the new site aims to boosts the visibility
 and online image of the company. The goal was a minimalist design that
  exudes an official style, well-defined structure and clear navigation.</p>

<p>The Concord Group, which includes a number of companies and organizations,
 focuses on the industrial construction, metallurgical waste products
  processing and wind power industries. Concord Group has operations
   in multiple countries within Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle
    East. The company has headquarters in the Ukraine, United Arab Emirates,
     China, and Poland.</p>

<p>The Concord Group and TechnoPark Corp. have enjoyed a business
 relationship for more than a year. The cooperation has yielded several
  successful contracts, of which the corporate website development project
   was the latest. </p>
