<title>WikiFox Project Finished</title>

<description>June 4, 2007 -- TechnoPark Corp. recently finished WikiFox,
 a German-language informational website providing details on other websites
 across the Internet. </description>

<text>

<p>WikiFox, located at <ahref name="http://www.wikifox.de">
http://www.wikifox.de</ahref>, gathers information about websites all over
the Web. Information collected includes website titles, descriptions,
keywords, logos, page ranks, site owner's details, etc. WikiFox users are
able to search this goldmine of data in seconds just by entering in a web
address. </p>

<p>WikiFox combines the revolution of user-based knowledge systems and search
 technology into a powerful new web research tool. With WikiFox, users are
 able to find information about websites and also edit WikiFox pages. Users
 can even add new pages and information of their own.</p>

<p> The system, based on MediaWiki opensource software, uses the Wiki database.
 In addition to OpenSource MediaWiki Engine, PHP was used for the project
 implementation. </p>

<p>The project was developed by TechnoPark Corp. and successfully delivered to
 TechnoPark Corp.'s customer. WikiFox will be supported and maintained by
 TechnoPark Corp. </p>
