	The new search engine is a personalized, small system that collects search information 
	from different search engines and then integrates it in one SERP. It can attract 
	niche customers, giving them the sum of what Google, Yahoo, MSN and other giants 
	can't give from one usable and intuitive interface. Zumber.com's unique value is 
	in it's search engine model. It is simple, fast and relevant and brings a 
	lot of marketing opportunities.

	<p>TechnoPark Corp., a custom software development company from Florida, finished 
	the creation of the configurable and personalized search engine. The product is 
	available at www.zumber.com domain.</p>

	<p>TechnoPark Corp. plans to work with the niche search engine market during 
	the next few years and already has a contract with a German company to 
	develop new niche search engine technology.</p>

	<p>The search engine market is a market that never stands still. It is very 
	young, but powerful and profitable. Search engines pro se became a very rich 
	channel for marketers and for prospect attraction. Google, Yahoo!, MSN 
	Search now are the sources of all information about the products and services. 
	From some point search engines can form a stable marketing position and either 
	help to build your business or to destroy it.</p>

	<p>When speaking about search advertising, we can't neglect to say that it 
	has the most significant share of all on-line advertising. As IAB (Interactive 
	Advertising Bureau) had shown in its reports, near 41 percent of all online 
	advertising in 2007 was spent on search advertising. Research firm ZenithOptimedia 
	predicts US online ad spending to grow 23.4% in 2008. Global ad spending 
	online will rise 26.5% in 2008 to $47.7 bln.</p>

	<p>TechnoPark Corp. provides the service of project management in software 
	projects, banding programmers, analysts, architects, testers and artitsts 
	together in virtual teams. Due to a number of patent-pending methods of 
	project organization, estimation and coordination TechnoPark Corp. is achieving 
	efficiency and effectiveness in the software development marketplace.</p>
