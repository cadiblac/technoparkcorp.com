	TechnoPark Corp. reveals a simple mechanism of test planning 
	for software development projects, which obliges a software 
	team to anticipate bugs in a software product in advance.
</description>

<text>

	<p>The most common and the most damaging assumption in software development is 
	that "quality software has no bugs." In an article published on 
	their website, TechnoPark Corp. explains that quality of software 
	consists of the anticipation, discovery, and resolution of bugs. These 
	three measures lead to a high quality of software products, and were 
	successfully implemented in seven software projects completed by TechnoPark Corp. during the last year.</p>

	<p>More details about these measures are available on the TechnoPark Corp. 
	<a href="http://www.technoparkcorp.com/innovations/test-planning">website</a>. TechnoPark Corp. is 
	a software development general contractor that uses automated innovative metrics to make 
	complex full-scale project management simple and clear.</p>
