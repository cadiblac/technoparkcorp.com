<title>Requirements-Based Software Development Process Introduced in 
TechnoPark Corp.</title>

<description>The process of integration and documentation of a requirements-based 
software development approach has been finished at TechnoPark Corp.
</description>

<text>
<p>Now the company offers the new level of services to its customers.</p>

<p>The final introduction of this new approach to the software development process 
was prefaced by three months of personnel training which included tutorials and 
practical seminars for project managers, system analysts, software 
architects, and software developers. </p>

<p>The decision to study and use requirements-based software development 
process arose  from recognition of its importance. Requirements-based software 
development is a guarantee that the software product will meet customer's 
requirements when it is developed. It is based on the assumption that exact 
requirements for the software system are not known until the system is 
developed. That is why the company instituted iterative approach as grounds 
for requirements-based development. </p>

<p>With the introduction of this software development model, requirements 
management and becomes one of the core disciplines in company operations. 
Project managers, system analysts, and developers are involved in requirements 
management and requirements change management. </p>

<p>The requirements-based approach provides that all requirements must be 
listed in specification document and approved by the customer before the start of 
implementation. Then, during the whole software development process, a certain 
piece of workable software is released each iteration, and this source code is 
tied to certain requirement(s). Frequent releases and connection with certain 
requirements assure that the software is being developed according to the customer's 
vision.  In addition, this approach eases and clarifies Requirements Change 
Management.</p>

<p>Now, requirements-based process is already used in TechnoPark Corp. adding 
value to the company's customers.</p>
