	Virtual team concept for outsourcing development
</description>

<text>

	<p>For each new project we build and manage a dedicated distributed team of 
	narrow-skilled technicians. Each role in a project is being filled by
	the best suitable talent (<a href="${url:contacts/sup}">tell us about your uniqueness</a> and we will invite
	you to one of our projects), the company or an individual.</p>
	
	<p>The project team includes individuals and companies' engineers from
	different countries across the globe. With our project management toolkit you
	interact with documents, project manager and the team effectively
	and without redundant communications.</p>

	<p>Our typical projects require system analysts, 
	software architects, software designers, programmers, test analysts,
	testers, technical/management reviewers, graphic artists, and system administators.</p>
