<description>
    Iterative and incremental process delivers full-scale project
    management methods and principles to your agile project, without
    bureaucracy and burden. We make the project management 
    simple and easy-to-use by means of our automated instant metrics.

    <p>We implement full-scale PMBOK-inspired project management and
    make its every last detail valuable and easy-to-understand by means
    of instant automated metrics. Complex project management principles, 
    documents, processes and rules are transparent for you with our
    project management web panel.</p>

    <p>Our software development lifecycle is iterative and incremental. We deliver software product
    by independent builds at the end of each <a href="${url:process/time/iteration}">Iteration</a>. 
    You approve <a href="${url:process/time/schedule}">Schedule</a> at the
    <a href="${url:process/time/lco}">LCO milestone</a> in the first weeks of a project, and then track it by 
    <a href="${url:process/time/spi}">Earned Value</a> data.</p>

    <p>The diagram shows how your informal request is transferred to Deliverables, 
    which you accept at the end of the project:</p>

    <p style="text-align: center"><tikz>
\begin{tikzpicture}
    [node distance = 2.5cm, 
    auto, thick]

    \node [cloud, draw=tpcRed, cloud ignores aspect, fill=tpcRed!40] (request) {Informal Request};
    \node [block, below=0.8cm of request] (vision) {Vision};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of vision] (rom) {ROM Estimate};
        \node [block, below=0.5cm of rom.south east] (retainer) {Retainer};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of rom] (scheduleEstimate) {Schedule Estimate};
    \node [draw=tpcBlue, dashed, fit=(vision) (rom) (retainer) (scheduleEstimate)] (inception) {};

    \node [block, below=2.8cm of vision] (srs) {SRS};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of srs] (budget) {Budget};
        \node [block, right=0.8cm of budget] (schedule) {Schedule};
        \node [block, below=0.5cm of budget.south east] (risks) {Risks};
    \node [draw=tpcBlue, dashed, fit=(srs) (budget) (risks) (schedule)] (projectBody) {};

    \node [choice, text width=2cm, below=2.5cm of srs] (lco) {LCO Milestone};

    \node [block, below=1.5cm of lco] (deliverables) {Deliverables};
    \node [block, below of=deliverables] (accepted) {Accepted Specification};

    \path [line] (request) -- (vision);
    \path [line] (vision) -- node [near end] {Requirements analysis and specification} (srs);
    \path [line] (srs) -- (lco);
    \path [line] (lco) -- node [right, text width=6cm] {Analysis, design, programming, testing and deployment} (deliverables);
    \path [line] (deliverables) -- node [right] {User Acceptance Testing} (accepted);

\end{tikzpicture}
    </tikz></p>

    <p>We work only with fixed-price projects that are estimated in two steps: 1) 
    <a href="${url:process/cost/rom}">ROM Estimate</a>
    defines the range of effort and time required, 2) 
    <a href="${url:process/cost/budget}">Budget</a> gives an exact amount of staff-hours required to complete the project.
    Such an approach optimizes costs of both parties.</p>

    <p>Software is developed according to Functional and Non-functional <a href="${url:process/scope/requirement}">Requirements</a>
    specified in <a href="${url:process/scope/specification}">Specification</a>, in form of a 
    <a href="${url:process/scope/srs}">SRS</a> document. Requirements are maintained in a
    <a href="${url:process/scope/matrix}">Traceability Matrix</a>
    that gives you and the project team the ability to bi-directionaly trace changes. 
    We tend to be flexible, however, project Specification can only be altered through 
    <a href="${url:process/scope/}">Change Requests</a>.</p>

    <p>Our process is risk-driven, meaning that <a href="${url:process/risk/risk}">Risks</a> and 
    <a href="${url:process/risk/strategy}">Risk Strategies</a> affect the
    project Schedule and Specification. 
    During the entire project lifecycle, the project team reviews the
    <a href="${url:process/risk/risklist}">Risk List</a> containing the most critical Risks, 
    and conducts Risk mitigation plans.</p>

    <p><a href="${url:process/quality}">Quality</a> of <a href="${url:process/warranty/deliverables}">Deliverables</a> is assured by 
    <a href="${url:process/quality/unit}">unit-testing</a>,
    <a href="${url:process/quality/peerreview}">peer reviews</a>,
    <a href="${url:process/quality/manual}">manual testing</a>, and
    <a href="${url:process/quality/system}">system testing</a>.</p>

    <p>Project <a href="${url:process/communication}">communications</a> are iterative and customer-focused.  They 
    include <a href="${url:process/communication/dailyreport}">Daily Reports</a>,
    <a href="${url:process/communication/incremental}">incremental delivery</a> of software product, 
    regular <a href="${url:process/communication/iam}">acceptance meetings</a> with project status
    reporting and monitoring.</p>

    <p>We proactively protect <a href="${url:process/ipr}">intellectual property rights</a> of software by means of 
    <a href="${url:process/ipr/nda}">Non-Disclosure Agreements</a> and 
    <a href="${url:process/ipr/security}">information security</a> internal policies and rules.</p>

    <p>When a project is closed, we continue to provide warranty <a href="${url:process/warranty/defectremoval}">defect removal</a> services for 
    <a href="${url:process/warranty/deliverables}">Deliverables</a>.</p>
