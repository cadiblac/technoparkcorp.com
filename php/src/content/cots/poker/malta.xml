    </p>

    <p>The steps mentioned above are detailed below.
    We can also put you in touch with a Maltese law &amp; consulting company that will help.</p>

    <h1>Step 1: Setup a Maltese Company and Apply for a Gambling License</h1>

            <p>The initial cost of setting up a Maltese company in order to apply for an online
            gaming licence will amount to around <b>5,500 EUR</b>, which includes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) registration fee, </li>
                <li>drafting of Memorandum &amp; Article, </li>
                <li>obtaining of stamp Duty Exemption, </li>
                <li>combined register and share certificates and </li>
                <li>obtaining of VAT registration. </li>
                <li>Company secretary</li>
                <li>Two nominee shareholders</li>
                <li>Registered office in Malta</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The application for the gambling license will cost an initial <b>2,330 EUR</b>.
            This application fee is not refundable should the application fail to be accepted.</p>

            <p>After you gather all necessary documentation and information, a law firm can file the application
            within two weeks. The application will take around 1 1/2 months to be processed, and
            then you will be given a six-month period within which to establish the business
            in Malta, conclude all necessary agreements and carry out the necessary testing of the
            set-up. After this six-month period, LGA will issue a formal licence after
            the compliance certificate is obtained, which normally takes two weeks.</p>

    <h1>Step 2: LGA Examination</h1>

            <p>The first stage is to conduct a fit and proper exercise on the applicant. LGA
            analyses all information related to persons involved in financing and management and
            on the business viability of the operation. LGA conducts probity investigations
            with other national and international regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies.
            It also carries out a financial analysis of the business plan. At this step, you will
            need legal guidance (<b>EUR 11,800</b>) and key official fees (<b>EUR 6,800</b>).</p>

            <p>For each qualifying shareholder with 5% or more interest, you will need:</p>

            <ol>
                    <li>Application for Remote Gaming Licence (form LGA/51/2004-1)</li>
                    <li>Personal Declaration form (form LGA/51/2004-2)</li>
                    <li>Copy of Passport</li>
                    <li>Original Birth Certificate</li>
                    <li>Police Conduct Certificate</li>
                    <li>Financial/Bank reference</li>
                    <li>Passport-size photo</li>
                    <li>Statement of Affairs</li>
                    <li>Bookmaker licence (if issued in other countries)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The business plan you submit will need include the following:</p>

            <ol>
                    <li>Overview of Business &amp; Objectives of Operation</li>
                    <li>Proposed company structure including human resources to be employed</li>
                    <li>Nature of games to be offered</li>
                    <li>Technologies to be used</li>
                    <li>Overview of application software</li>
                    <li>Three year business plan including:
                    (i) Marketing &amp; Sales Plan
                    (ii) Forecast profit &amp; loss and balance sheets
                    (iii) Forecast cash flow statement
                    (iv) Financing plan</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Once the documents above have been successfully inspected,
            the instruments required to conduct your business will be examined as well.
            This process includes examining
            incorporation documents; the games; the business processes related to conducting
            the remote games; the rules, terms, conditions and procedures of the games;
            the application architecture and system architecture of the gaming and control systems.</p>

            <p>At the end of the examination the applicant is given a Letter of
            Intent (LOI) to operate remote gaming with the intent of obtaining a certification
            of compliance within six months. The applicant may then establish the business in
            Malta, conclude all agreements and carry out testing of the set-up. A formal
            licence is issued when LGA obtains approval from the compliance
            certification entity. A normal compliance certification procedure takes two
            weeks to be carried out.</p>

            <p>A Service Provider Authorisation Form, if applicable, shall be included.
            This shall include the agreement with the
            equipment hosting provider in Malta, outlining clearly the functions and responsibilities to
            be carried out by such provider. A site plan of the data floor indicating the location
            of the equipment must be attached to the agreement. Serial numbers for all equipment
            installed are to be attached. </p>

            <p>Details or copies of agreements with all third parties which may impact the licensee's
            gaming or control systems are also required by LGA (such third parties include the gaming software provider,
            all payment service providers, any odds/results provider used, and any other software partners).</p>

               <ul>

                    <li>Before certification, the Control System submission will be reviewed and tests made
                    on the live data and procedures. Sample reports from the live system will be
                    requested to show how the management of the betting system is conducted. </li>

                    <li>An assessment of the information management in the operations will be made;
                    recommendations may be made to improve security of the players' data. </li>

                    <li>The backup and disaster recovery procedures will be reviewed. Change
                    management procedures will also be reviewed. </li>

                    <li>The online website will be reviewed via a test account to see that
                    the site operates in accordance with the regulations and with the operator's
                    declared procedures (including notifying changes).  The player protection measures
                    required by LGA will be confirmed. </li>

                    <li>Bank account balances will be compared with online player account balances
                    to ensure that the liabilities are sufficiently covered. </li>

                    <li>Routine data submitted on a monthly basis to LGA will be reviewed.  Any anomalies
                    will be investigated with the operator to ensure that correct data is available to
                    LGA and rules relating to test data are observed.  Spot checks on the odds,
                    payout ratios, and randomness, as applicable, may be made. </li>

                    <li>Any agents acting for the operator will be scrutinised for probity.  Copies
                    of all relevant agreements and national licenses
                    will be required by LGA for review and filing. </li>

                    <li>Staff lists and duties will be checked against the records held at LGA. </li>

                </ul>

    <h1>Step 3: Deployment</h1>

        <p>After the "Letter of Intent" is issued by LGA, you will deploy your system
        and set-up the business in Malta. You will have to pay an annual license fee of <b>EUR 7,000</b>
        pluc a compliance audit fee of <b>EUR 5,000</b>.</p>

    <h1>Step 4: Maintenance</h1>

        <p>The licence is then issued for a period of five years.</p>

        <p>Each year, you will have to pay:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A 5% income tax</li>
            <li>An <b>EUR 83,844</b> Gaming Tax (<b>EUR 8,987</b> monthly)</li>
            <li>A server hosting fee (in Malta) of <b>EUR 4,200</b></li>
