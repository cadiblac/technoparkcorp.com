Rough-Order-of-Magnitude (ROM) Estimate was made by 
<?=$this->itemize($this->sheet->estimators, 'inline')?>
estimators using our own patent-pending estimating method (based on COCOMO-II, 
three-point estimate and function point analysis). According to the estimate
project size is
\textbf{<?=$this->sheet->lowBoundary?>--<?=$this->sheet->highBoundary?> staff-hours}. 
This means that right now we are ready to start Inception phase, perform proper requirements
analysis, analyze risks and re-estimate project cost. We guarantee that final project
cost will be in the declared interval.
