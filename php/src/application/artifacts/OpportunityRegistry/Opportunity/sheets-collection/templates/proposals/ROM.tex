Rough-Order-of-Magnitude (ROM) Estimate was made by our technical and 
management specialists: 
<?=$this->itemize($this->sheet->estimators, 'inline')?>.
We're using our own patent-pending estimating method (based on COCOMO-II, 
three-point estimate and function point analysis).
According to the estimate
project size is
<?=$this->sheet->lowBoundary?>--<?=$this->sheet->highBoundary?>{} staff-hours. 
This means that right now we are ready to start Inception Phase,
to perform proper requirements analysis, 
to analyze risks and to re-estimate project cost.
We guarantee that final fixed project cost will be in the promised interval.
