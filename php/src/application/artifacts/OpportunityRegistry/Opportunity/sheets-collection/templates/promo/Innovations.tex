\section*{Our Innovations}

The greatest value of our company is \href{${url:innovations}}{our innovations} in the field
of software engineering and project management. Some of them we patent with 
\href{http://www.uspto.gov}{USPTO} and \href{http://www.epo.org}{EPO}, while
others we keep as internal \textit{know-how}. Our most important innovations and inventions
are:

	\begin{itemize}
    	\item \textbf{Puzzle Driven Development}. 
    	We invented a unique mechanism of management in distributed parallel programming
    	\href{${url:about/teams}}{virtual teams}
    	(USPTO patent application \href{${url:innovations/pdd}}{12/840,306}).

    	\item \textbf{phpRack}.
    	We invented and implemented a unique instrument for
    	integration testing realization, which is an
    	independent open-source product available 
    	at \href{http://www.phprack.com}{www.phparck.com}.

    	\item \textbf{Quality Metrics}. 
    	We invented a mechanism of quality control in software projects, which
    	enables much higher level of manageability and predictability
    	(USPTO patent application \href{${url:innovations/metrics}}{12/264,370}).

    	\item \textbf{Scope Champions}.
    	We invented a method of software project size estimation, which 
    	gives more accurate results, and faster
    	(USPTO patent application \href{${url:innovations/scope-champions}}{12/193,010}). 

    	\item \textbf{FaZend}.
    	We invented and implemented a Zend Framework based
    	library and a continuous integration platform for web-intensive
    	PHP projects, available as free service
    	at \href{http://www.fazend.com}{www.fazend.com}.

    	\item \textbf{Risk Management}. 
    	We invented a method of \href{${url:process/risk}}{risk} identification
    	that allows us to identify more risks faster and more efficiently
    	(see \href{${url:innovations/risk-game}}{details}).
	\end{itemize}

The majority of our innovations come from project managers and their
day-to-day work. Our ``Inventions Policy'' encourages and motivates our employees
do the innovative work.
