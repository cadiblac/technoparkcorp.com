We analyzed the documentation we have about your project and 
created a new scope-definition document called Vision. This document
is a preliminary scope specification. Its purpose is to become
a common ground between us during estimation, calculations and contract
approval. Vision covers the whole scope at the highest possible level
of abstraction.
