had been our client for four years, until the end of 2009

With a 30-people dedicated team of C++, Java, and PHP
engineers we have been developing a proximity hosting provider, responsible for
market data and order routing for traders, hedge funds, and financial service providers.

cross-connect services at ISE's co-location facility (read more on

Due to the crisis of 2008 the project was postponed by its investors.
