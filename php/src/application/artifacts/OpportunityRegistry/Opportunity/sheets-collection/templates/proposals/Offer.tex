Project size is calculated in flat staff-hours, where one staff-hour
will cost you \textbf{<?=$this->tex($this->sheet->pricePerHour)?>}. This includes
all direct and indirect expenses, like payments to technicians and project 
manager, equipment rental, communications, management reserve, warranty,
and our profit. Fixed project budget will be calculated and announced
right after the specification is developed, and we guarantee that it
will be somewhere between \textbf{<?=$this->tex($this->sheet->lowAmount)?>{}
and <?=$this->tex($this->sheet->highAmount)?>}.
To start a project we will kindly ask you for a deposit
of <?=$this->tex($this->sheet->depositAmount)?>.
