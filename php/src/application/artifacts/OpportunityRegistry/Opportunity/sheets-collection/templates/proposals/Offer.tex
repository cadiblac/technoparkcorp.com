<? if ($this->sheet->hasPrice()): ?>

    Project size is calculated in flat staff-hours, where one staff-hour
    will cost you \textbf{<?=$this->tex($this->sheet->pricePerHour)?>}. This includes
    all direct and indirect expenses, like payments to technicians and project 
    manager, equipment rental, communications, management reserve, warranty,
    and our profit. Fixed project budget will be calculated and announced
    right after the specification is developed, and we guarantee that it
    will be somewhere between \textbf{<?=$this->tex($this->sheet->lowAmount)?>{}
    and <?=$this->tex($this->sheet->highAmount)?>}.
    To start a project we will kindly ask you for a deposit
    of <?=$this->tex($this->sheet->depositAmount)?>.

    \textbf{The proposal is still in DRAFT MODE and we can't calculate
    the price/duration of the project. Some information is missing
    and we expect to receive it soon from you. Thanks.}
