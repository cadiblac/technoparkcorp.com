\section*{Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)}

This is a preliminary \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Breakdown_Structure}{WBS} 
of the work packages we are going to perform in the project. The exact list will
be defined during the Inception Phase and approved with you.
Here we assume (optimistic scenario) that project budget will equal
<?=$this->sheets['ROM']->lowBoundary?>{} staff-hours.

<?=$this->sheet->getSpreadsheet()?>{}

Some of the work packages listed above will take more time, some
will take less. However, in general, all of them have to be present
in the project.
