\section*{Company Structure of TechnoPark Corp.}

There is \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management}{a strong matrix} organizational structure in TechnoPark Corp.,
with four major project stakeholder groups: Customer, Product Users, Project Manager
and Suppliers. Functional departments and roles surround the project
and give it necessary support, like quality control, resources, finances,
trainings, etc.

\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}
\setstretch{1.1}
\tikzstyle{project} = [draw=tpcBlue, fill=tpcBlue!30, text width=2cm, text centered, minimum height=1.5cm]
\tikzstyle{unit} = [font=\bfseries, text=tpcBlack, text width=2.5cm, text centered]
\tikzstyle{unit2} = [font=\small, text=tpcBlack, text width=2.5cm, text centered]

\coordinate (cntr) at (5,5);

\node [project, above left=2mm of cntr, anchor=center] (p1) {};
\node [project, below right=2mm of cntr, anchor=center] (p2) {};
\node [project, anchor=center, outer sep=3mm] (prj) at (cntr) {Project in thePanel};

\node [unit, above right=3mm of prj] (pm) {Project Manager};
\node [unit, above left=3mm of prj] (customer) {Customer};
\node [unit, below right=3mm of prj] (suppliers) {Suppliers};
\node [unit, below left=3mm of prj] (users) {Product Users};

\draw [draw=tpcBlue] (pm) -- (prj);
\draw [draw=tpcBlue] (customer) -- (prj);
\draw [draw=tpcBlue] (suppliers) -- (prj);
\draw [draw=tpcBlue] (users) -- (prj);

\node [outer sep=1.5cm, shape=ellipse, inner sep=-2mm, fit=(pm) (customer) (suppliers) (users), dashed, draw=tpcBlue, thick] (circle) {};
\node [shape=ellipse, inner sep=-2mm, fit=(pm) (customer) (suppliers) (users)] (circle1) {};

\foreach \pos/\label in {
	25/{Finance Director}, 
	60/{Software Engineering Process Group (SEPG)},
	100/{Corporate Attorney},
	135/{Project Management Office (PMO)},
	155/{Human Resources (HR)},
	210/{Director},
	230/{Chief Security Officer (CSO)},
	265/{Quality Assurance (QA) Director},
	300/{Sales Director},
	325/{Marketing Director}
} {
	\node [unit2, below=0mm of circle.\pos, anchor=center] (unit\pos) {\label};
	\draw [draw=tpcBlue, thick, -angle 60] (unit\pos) -- (circle1);
}	
\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}

The Customer, Product Users, and Suppliers are located outside of the company, while
others work in-house, on a full-time basis.

Hierarchical reporting is centered around thePanel patent-pending software, where
everybody has access to dedicated quality control metrics. De-centralized
management is one of our unique advantages, which gives us a strong self-motivation
and engagement of all project participants and company workers:

\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}
\setstretch{1.1}
\tikzstyle{ln} = [-angle 60, draw=tpcBlue, thick]

\node [circle, minimum width=2cm, draw=tpcBlue, fill=tpcBlue!30] (panel) {thePanel};
\node [circle, minimum width=2cm, outer sep=1.6cm] (panelX) {};

\node [draw=tpcBlue, inner sep=2mm, left=3cm of panel] (director) {Director};
\node [draw=tpcBlue, inner sep=2mm, above=1cm of director] (bod) {Board of Directors}; 
\node [draw=tpcBlue, inner sep=2mm, above=1cm of bod] (shareholders) {Shareholders};

\draw [ln] (shareholders) -- (bod);
\draw [ln] (bod) -- (director);
\draw [ln] (director) -- (panel);

\foreach \pos/\label in {
	35/{Finance Director}, 
	70/{Software Engineering Process Group (SEPG)},
	115/{Corporate Attorney},
	150/{Project Management Office (PMO)},
	220/{Human Resources (HR)},
	255/{Chief Security Officer (CSO)},
	290/{Quality Assurance (QA) Director},
	325/{Sales Director},
	360/{Marketing Director}
} {
	\node [font=\scriptsize, text width=1.5cm, text centered, below=0mm of panelX.\pos, anchor=center] (unit\pos) {\label};
	\draw [ln] (unit\pos) -- (panel);
}	
\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}

Such structure of our company gives us and our customers a number
of important advantages:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{One Goal for All}. The Project Manager, Customer and everybody in the company share the same
	goal -- ``to finish the project on-time and in-budget'';

	\item \textbf{No Interference}. There is no interference to the project work from the Director or
	any other managers in the company;

	\item \textbf{Open Communications}. The Customer may communicate with any member of the project team (including 
	programmers and testers) without any limitations;

	\item \textbf{One Point of View}. The Customer and Director perceive the same project indicators,
	which guarantees that there will be just one objective point of view to the project results.
	\end{itemize}
