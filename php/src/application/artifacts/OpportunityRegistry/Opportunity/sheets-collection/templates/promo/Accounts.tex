\section*{Latest Won and Lost Accounts}

There are five project managers in <?=$this->href('about/teams', 'our team')?>. Each of them
works with one project (sometimes with two). Projects usually take 6-10 months during an average 
<?=$this->href('process/time/schedule', 'schedule')?> duration. We
complete 6-10 projects annually. This is a list of the best ten accounts we have served 
for the last two years:

Sometimes projects fail for <?=$this->href('process/risk/risk', 'different reasons')?>. This is a list of 
three accounts we unfortunately lost during the last two years and the corresponding causes
for those losses:

								UK &	2200 \\
TipTop & 		Inception phase took too much time due
			to vague business requirements 
			(over 10 weeks).
			Customer business motivation in the 
			project has disappeared during
			this time, project was terminated. & 
								Russia &	1400 \\
Bild.ag & 		Business objectives were not taken
			into account by the project team (e.g., critical market 
			deadlines) and the software final release
			was not beneficial to the customer.
			The project was terminated before reaching
			its budget potential. & 		Germany &	900 \\
\end{mpxtabular}\end{center}

In order to keep the level of failed projects low we do 
regular process improvement, <?=$this->href('process/risk', 'risk management')?>, 
training and education of project managers, 
<?=$this->href('process/quality', 'quality')?> control and assurance.
