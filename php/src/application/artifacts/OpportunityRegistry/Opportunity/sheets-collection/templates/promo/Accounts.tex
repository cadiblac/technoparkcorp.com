\section*{Latest Won and Lost Accounts}

There are five project managers in \href{${url:about/teams}}{our team}. Each of them
works with one project (sometimes with two). Projects usually take 6-10 months during an average 
\href{${url:process/time/schedule}}{schedule} duration. We
complete 6-10 projects annually. This is a list of the best ten accounts we have served 
for the last two years:

In order to keep the level of failed projects low we do 
regular process improvement, \href{${url:process/risk}}{risk management}, 
training and education of project managers, 
\href{${url:process/quality}}{quality} control and assurance.
