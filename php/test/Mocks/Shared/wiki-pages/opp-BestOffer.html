    <ul>
        <li>The information we received through vWorker.com website
            is rather limited in terms of business objectives and
            applicability of the developed system. We still don't know
            who is the target customer of the system, who are the users,
            when and how the system is going to reach them. We hope
            to receive this information later, during the system analysis
            phase and development.</li>
        <li>We have received one PDF document (7 pages), and a collection
            of user interface mock-up PDF files (8 files). Also we have
            a number of workflow diagrams that help us in understanding
            of user functionality (3 PDF files).</li>

<h1>Vision</h1>

    <p>Statement: Nowadays the amount of different devices
        installed and used in a typical living house is growing. At least 
        every modern house has a TV, a few computers, a few laptops,
        sound system with home cinema, lights control system, 
        and security system. Sooner or later every component 
        will provide a digital interface to its functionality, through
        Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or some other interface. There is a market
        opportunity to give end user the ability to control all 
        devices through one simple and intuitive interface, preferably through
        TV panel. The customer is trying to pursue this opportunity
        and develop such an integrating system. Moreover, with the
        fast growing of Internet and its presence in almost every house
        there is an opportunity to interconnect such an integrating system
        with a central server and make it networking instead of standalone.</p>
    
    <p>Product: This SUD is a software component installed on one
        of home computers, and connected to TV. The SUD acts as
        a mediator between end user and all other components. The
        user communicates with them through one simple and unified
        user interface. Every component is represented in the SUD
        by its "Gadget" or "Application" (Gadget's viewpoint is limited
        and fixed, while Application has bigger space and more flexibility
        in interaction with end user). The SUD when working becomes a
        network element of a web system, with a center at <tt>ruzoid.com</tt>.</p>
    
    <p>Actors:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Householder: a human being managing the system in his own (or rented) house,
            also known as "administrator". Householder is a User as well and all functionality
            available for a User is available for a Householder.
            <ul>
                <li>F1: "Manage Gadgets" Householder 
                    can install, configure and remove gadgets and applications;
                    can grant/revoke permissions to other users for particular gadgets and applications;
                    can get access to "security zone" of every gadget and application.
                </li>
                <li>F2: "Manage Users" Householder 
                    can create, delete, change/configure other users;
                    can monitor protocols of users activity;
                    can block certain types of access for particular users.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>User: a regular user of the system, probably one of Householder's relatives
            or guests
            <ul>
                <li>F3: "Play with Gadgets" User 
                    can start and stop any Application;
                    can add and remove certain Gadgets to his "panel";
                    can play with gadgets and applications according to the rules/terms of their usage.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Gadget: a software component provided by a third-party or by the customer, that
            comply to some requirements for its application programming interface (API). Gadget
            and Application are almost the same type of an actor, but they differ in
            their user interface capabilities.
            <ul>
                <li>F4: "Perform" Gadget 
                    can interact with a User through the SUD, 
                    sending to us its output and receiving back users' input. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Server: a web service provider hosted at <tt>ruzoid.com</tt>
            <ul>
                <li>F5: "Web Service" Server 
                    can receive logs from SUD, keep them in secure place, and return on demand;
                    can authenticate users and authorize their access requests;
                    can "rent" Applications and Gadgets to the SUD;
                    can send emails to users through built-in SMTP server.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Quality:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Attractiveness: The user interface of the SUD has to be comfortable
            for a modern user, used to work with iPhone, iPad and similar
            devices. It is desired to have an ability to use the majority of
            functions without keyboard or mouse. Alternatives are touch-screen,
            a simple few-buttons TV remote control, or something like 
            Apple remote control.
        </li>
        <li>Interoperability: The SUD has to work both on Windows
            and Mac OS platforms. The Customer proposed to use Silverlight
            and Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)
            as a software platform. The SUD has to have a properly documented
            interface available to third-party developers, since they
            might be interested to develop their own Gadgets and Applications
            (most possible they will be manufacturers of house equipment).
            <i>If Silverlight is selected as a target software platform, all
            Gadgets and Applications will have to be developed in Silverlight,
            which imply certain limitation on marketing of the entire product.</i>
        </li>

                <li>F4: ML=200, BC=160, WC=600</li>
                <li>I think that the biggest risk for us is in integration with XML feeds... 
                    they might change protocols in time and we should somehow adapt our
                    software to such changes... also we should pay attention to the database
                    design.. 40 sites sounds rather risky and might take more time than
                    expected..</li>

                <li>F4: FP=14, C=2</li>
                <li>This project is interesting, but very risky because we will
                    deal with rather "closed" processes, nobody will help us in the market,
                    we will not be able to get technical help from bettors for example. I 
                    would pay extreme attention to performance and reliability.
                    40 sites looks like a big chunk of work, and might take more
                    time than expected.</li>

<h1>SAO</h1>

    <p>Components:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Gadgets: collection of Silverlight/MEF gadgets stored locally, but
            originally retrieved from the Server.</li>
        <li>Front: set of UI components interacting with the end-user</li>
        <li>Dispatcher: controller, interacting with Front, Gadgets and Server
            <ul>
                <li>Gadgets: installing, configuring, rendering</li>
                <li>Front: collecting inputs, producing outputs</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Concepts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>MVC: There is a good situation to apply a classic Model-View-Controller
            design pattern, where Model is a collection of Gadgets and Applications,
            View is Front, and Controller is a Dispatcher. Thus we have
            a strict separation of Front and Gadgets.</li>
    </ul>
