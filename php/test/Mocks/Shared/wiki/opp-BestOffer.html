    <p>intro:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The information we received from ATG about "betting arbitrage"
            business concept and proposed automation of its manual routine operation
            was sufficient to understand software project scope, complexity, risks and
            to estimate its cost. We understood that the system to be
            developed shall semi-automatically execute "contradictory" orders
            for automatically discovered betting opportunities. The system shall
            automatically interact with many (from several to several dozens)
            betting websites, collect betting lines from them and place bets.</li>
        <li>We understand that there are some risks in the proposed business model,
            including financial (e.g., bettors eventual shutdown), technical
            (eventual account closing, protocol changes, etc.) and organizational
            (strategy is highly dependable on proprietary non-formal knowledge
            possessed by in-house ATG individuals). Despite the risky nature
            of this business we still find it feasible for us to participate,
            as a technical developer of the software solution.</li>
        <li>The software will be developed in an iterative manner, incrementally
            increasing the number of features and amount of implemented functionality.
            This proposal and its numbers are related to the first release
            of the system, which is rather clear for us in scope.</li>

<h1>Vision</h1>

    <p>Statement: There is a strong marketing opportunity to automate
        an experience earned by ATG during the last 5 years of
        doing manual "betting arbitrage". The sports betting marketplace is still 
        extremely inefficient and there are arbitrage opportunities (called "<i>arbs</i>") between two 
        sports books somewhere in the world every second of every day. It is 
        a risk-free arbitrage because there is an overlap in pricing for the exact 
        same event, in the exact same market, with the exact same rules. 
        We are creating an automated algorithmic trading software, based on years 
        of experience, that will find these short-lasting opportunities 
        across the globe and with lightening-fast execution bet both sides of 
        the opportunity within seconds.</p>
    
    <p>Product: Semi-automated betting comparison robotic software
        system, that compares betting rates, discovers arbs, 
        and places bets. The system is intended for
        private use by a limited number of managers, mostly in-house
        staff of ATG. The system is a pure "web system" to be hosted
        on a server in Internet.</p>
    
    <p>Actors:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Bettor: Betting web site, e.g. <tt>pinnaclesports.com</tt>,
            <tt>ladbrokes.com</tt>, <tt>williamhill.com</tt>, and <tt>bwin.com</tt>. In first
            version of the system we will use <b>two websites</b> and <b>one sport</b> only.
            <ul>
                <li>F1: "Feed XML" Bettor can feed the system with XML-formatted betting lines,
                    according to its internal structure of data, the system can
                    receive said data and parse them before processing, the system
                    can understand betting lines, store them in the database
                    and prepare for analysis.</li>
                <li>F4: "40 sites" Bettor can be one of 40 betting sites,
                    with 5 accounts for each. The system can manage accounts
                    of these sites, and fully automate the entire betting process.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Manager: Representative of ATG controlling the system results
            <ul>
                <li>F2: "Confirm Bets" Manager can review arbs discovered, can review
                    bets suggested by the system, can confirm bets, can monitor how the
                    system is placing bets with bettors (in automated mode)</li>
                <li>F3: "Monitoring" Manager can review system statistic reports,
                    can review performance reports, can change system configuration
                    parameters without changing of source code, can make corrections
                    to the core algorithm/strategy of the system.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Quality:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Reliability: Due to the nature of the business and high
            probability of financial risks the system shall be extremely reliable
            in terms of financial transactions. No event either from end-user
            or from technical equipment shall lead to invalid financial transactions
            executed.</li>
        <li>Extendability: Since the betting strategy is very volatile and
            not fixed in time, the system shall be easily configurable and changeable.
            Adding of new bettors, new strategy mechanisms, new protocols shall
            be done fast and seamlessly.</li>
    </ul>

                <li>I think that the biggest risk for us is in integration with XML feeds... 
                    they might change protocols in time and we should somehow adapt our
                    software to such changes... also we should pay attention to the database
                    design.. 40 sites sounds rather risky and might take more time than
                    expected..</li>

                <li>F4: FP=14, C=2</li>
                <li>This project is interesting, but very risky because we will
                    deal with rather "closed" processes, nobody will help us in the market,
                    we will not be able to get technical help from bettors for example. I 
                    would pay extreme attention to performance and reliability.
                    40 sites looks like a big chunk of work, and might take more
                    time than expected.</li>
