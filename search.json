The final introduction of this new approach to the software development process was prefaced by three months of personnel training which included tutorials and practical seminars for project managers, system analysts, software architects, and software developers. The decision to study and use requirements-based software development process arose from recognition of its importance. Requirements-based software development is a guarantee that the software product will meet customer's requirements when it is developed. It is based on the assumption that exact requirements for the software system are not known until the system is developed. That is why the company instituted iterative approach as grounds for requirements-based development. With the introduction of this software development model, requirements management and becomes one of the core disciplines in company operations. Project managers, system analysts, and developers are involved in requirements management and requirements change management. The requirements-based approach provides that all requirements must be listed in specification document and approved by the customer before the start of implementation. Then, during the whole software development process, a certain piece of workable software is released each iteration, and this source code is tied to certain requirement(s). Frequent releases and connection with certain requirements assure that the software is being developed according to the customer's vision. In addition, this approach eases and clarifies Requirements Change Management. Now, requirements-based process is already used in TechnoPark Corp. adding value to the company's customers.

How to be sure my payment is secure? The question is burning for all the links of the chain: payment service providers, applications developers, merchants, and cardholders. Today, there is a unified approach to security standards. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a list of unified standards and requirements for the industry. However, only 20% of the major industry-related companies are PCI DSS compliant. This is stimulated by mid-tier merchants' and service providers' ignorance of the certificate though they are the most vulnerable objects of attacks. According to WordPress' report, many payment industry players feel the standard is not clear or is not being applied prudently to encourage complete adoption. Anyhow, PCI DSS must be the most comprehensive solution - and positively the best at this stage. Visa together with world's major payment systems strongly encourages payment service providers, merchants and payment applications developers to pass the PCI DSS compliance certification in order to be able to guarantee high-level security to both their customers and partners. Understanding the importance of security matter, TechnoPark Corp., an outsourcing software development company, has released mobile payment processing system which meets all the standards provided by PCI DSS. The system enables users to pay for goods and services using only their mobile phones, and provides a number of additional functions like statistics, notifications, etc. Laboratory testing assured the product's compliance, so it is about to be sent to Visa for certification. PCI Data security standard was developed by Visa and MasterCard and accepted by other major players. It provides 12 basic standards aiming to stamp out debit and credit card fraud, by introducing strict security standards for handling and keeping cardholder data. The six general principles of PCI DSS include the following: build and maintain a secure network, protect cardholder data, maintain a vulnerability management program, implement strong access control measures, regularly monitor and test networks, maintain an information security policy. In the article devoted to data security standards Joan Herbig, President and CEO of Cambia Security, a security policy enforcement provider, writes for CSO Magazine: \"Embracing the PCI standard may sound like a big task, and you may wonder if it's even necessary for your business. However, before you fill up your dance card with other priorities, consider this: As of now, there is no known case of a PCI-compliant network being compromised.\" For software developers Visa/MasterCard provides the PCI DSS Compliance Payment Application Certificate. Only 50 payment applications have been validated by today. On the intense and constantly growing market it sounds shocking. 50 is a tiny piece of all available products. Moreover, the up-to-date list includes only 1 payment application for cellular phones - the most fast-growing industry's tenderfoot (A survey from Visa USA, reported in Bank Systems & Technology, shows that 61% of the respondents ages 25 to 34 were interested in making purchases via their cellphones). Still the adoption of PCI Data security standard may dramatically intensify anti-fraud efforts. Thus, the major payment systems recommend choosing PCI DSS compliant services and products. It must be a cue for US and European companies as well as worldwide outsourcing software development firms striving to offer high-quality products. In light of this, the introduction of TechnoPark Corp.'s MPPS software and its compliance validation, scheduled for September 2006, is a piece of important shift towards the consolidation of high standards of payment card industry.

New generation VoIP exchange software is expected to solve the problem. IP telephony is a relatively new kind of telecommunication activity. It emerged in the 90's and succeeded in competing with traditional kinds of voice-to-voice communication. Still, the intermediaries supress the market's development with their high tariffs and limited capabilities. That leads to an increase in service costs for the final customers and decreases the number of available routes. As a result, profits of both sellers (terminators) and buyers (originators) fall. According to industry experts, IP telephony market tends to eliminate intermediaries which may lead to price-cutting for customers. Until recently, clearing houses have been the most popular intermediaries in VoIP traffic trading. However, even though they assume the lion's share of trading job and spare the exchange participants most routine troubles, clearing houses have a number of grave disadvantages and run the gauntlet. Having bought traffic from a terminator, they are able to sell it for a much higher price. Opponents of clearing houses argue that they are an effective money-making scheme generating a questionable value. IP Telephony Exchange is a new model of traffic exchange. It is already employed in the U.S. and western Europe, but is not widely used yet. De facto VoIP Exchange is an online marketplace for traffic trading with a clear market pricing basis. The model is targeted to providing more freedom to terminators and originators, therefore it is gaining popularity worldwide. This gradation from intermediary to close cooperation proves that IP telephony market success is becoming dependent on VoIP exchange software developers. VoIP exchange software must meet a number of requirements including every aspect of operation, such as high-quality connection, failure free compliance of equipment of any manufacturer, online statistics, etc. The automation of the process is another vital issue. Despite the claimed automation, the majority of online marketplaces are managed manually now. New generation VoIP exchange software is expected to solve the numerous problems of IP telephony market participants. Technopark Corp.'s new product is an innovative solution. The VoIP platform development project has been launched in August 2006. Dynamical routing will be the main innovation. Dynamical routing is an ability to switch to a better quality channel automatically. In so doing the system is planned to select a channel with the same capabilities and price. Dynamical routing may improve connection quality without increasing cost of a call. No VoIP exchange has provided such opportunity until now. The project is also aimed to enable processing the requests for origination ortermination of connections through H.323 and SIP protocols and provide a number of new useful functions as well as those already implemented by other exchanges. The software will enable overall control over the origination and termination session processes, access to detailed statistics reports for each session, supervision over service quality, advising operators on the choice of appropriate equipment, etc. The TechnoPark Corp.'s VoIP Exchange Platform is also planned to have integrated billing system. Final testing and product release are scheduled for October 2006. The product will be introduced to the U.S. market.

This year one of the sections will be devoted to regional software development centers and their trends. In progress of the section's operation several presentations and round-table discussions, where every participant will have a chance to ask questions and share ideas concerning the highlighted issues, will be held. TechnoPark Corp. will lay upon the tables the most burning problems of regional offshore outsourcing. In spite of the presentation's focus on theDnepropetrovsk Region, many discussed problems are similar in most companies all over Ukraine. \"There are a lot of problems: qualification of personnel, low quality of software, small projects - all these are only a few of the thorniest issues,\" says Anna Stetsenko, HR Director at TechnoPark Corp. During the presentation titled \"Outsourcing Software Development in Dnepropetrovsk Region: Customer-driven Model\" TechnoPark Corp. will cover the most important problems of regional companies and provide its solutions. According to TechnoPark Corp., customer-driven process is the best means for stable growth and improvment of service quality. Today, western clients are no longer wary of outsourcing their projects to eastern Europe. But now they want to get proper communications and high-quality software. There are basic aspects required from Ukrainian IT companies by customers from the US, western Europe, and other countries: standardization, certification, well arranged management and development processes, and quality assurance. From TechnoPark Corp., these are the factors which are worth being the core focus of developing regional software companies which are not able to compete with big development companies in the number of employees and scopes of marketing campaigns. Thus ISO standardization, partnership opportunities (Oracle, Microsoft), management and development technologies (XP, MSF, RUP, Agile) as well as certification of engineers and software products will be the key issues of the presentation. Besides these issues, market volume, opportunities and advantages of the market, integration with other regions, situation in other big regions (Kharkov, Lvov, Kiev, Donetsk, Odessa, Vinnitsa), labor market and staff training, current market environment and leading Ukrainian companies will be referred to. Summarizing the long-term work over the presentation, including market research, study of the majority of big and medium-size companies in the region, co-operation with universities, and examination of the industry's development dynamics, TechnoPark Corp.'s research team points the positive trends. \"Despite the variety of problems, which are to be solved by IT Outsourcing industry in Dnepropetrovsk Region, without a doubt we are gradually transforming from 'backyard production' to world-recognized standards, and improve quality of our products\", assures Anna Stetsenko. The section devoted to regional software development centers will be open within the Ukrainian Outsourcing Forum on October 26. Odessa, Kharkov, Kiev, Lvov and Donetsk Regions will be presented there along with Dnepropetrovsk Region. "},{"title":"Technopark Corp.

The country's outsourcing turnover grows by 200-300% annually. Progressively more foreign customers choose to outsource their IT projects to Ukrainian companies. Still, both customers and outsourcing service providers realize that a number of problems are to be solved. At UOF - one of the most important outsourcing events in eastern Europe - the most burning problems were uncovered and discussed. Ukrainian outsourcing company TechnoPark Corp. made a presentation on the most urgent problems and suggested possible solutions. UOF 2006 showed that the Ukraine tends to contribute to the decentralization of outsourcing industry. One of the Forum's sections was devoted to regional outsourcing companies. Along with the country's capital, Kyiv, there are some powerful outsourcing regions in Ukraine: Kharkov Region, Odessa Region, Donetsk Region and Dnepropetrovsk Region. Representatives of regional companies as well as customers discussed the problems and potential of IT outsourcing in these locations. TechnoPark Corp.'s presentation, devoted to integration of customer-driven model, became the core of the section and provoked a heated dispute. So, here are some ideas on outsourcing IT projects to Ukrainian regional companies based on the report presented by TechnoPark Corp. - IT Outsourcing Company based in Dnepropetrovsk. First of all, who are the actors of Ukrainian regional outsourcing market? In each outsourcing region, 10-50 software companies operate. There are no big companies. The average staff is 50-100 employees with only a few companies employing 100+ personnel. Naturally, there are no big customers. Traditionally, medium and small businesses outsource their projects to regional companies. Obviously, most regions are far below their potential yet. The figures show that there are 6 high schools and 3 IT-education companies providing about 1500 graduates annually in Dnepropetrovsk. The figures are similar for most outsourcing regions of the country. \"Availability of high-class programmers doesn't assure high quality of project implementation. Well-organized process is what every company needs for success,\" says Anna Stetsenko, HR Director at TechnoPark Corp. By way of discussion all participants agreed that organization, planning and phasing are vital for offshore IT outsourcing. Anna Stetsenko spoke about the TechnoPark Corp's experience: \"This year we have implemented RUP-based development process. With RUP we are on the same wavelength with our foreign customers and they are happy to understand our process.\" According to TechnoPark Corp., good process includes communication skills (language skills and business etiquette), culture of collaborative work, dissociation of roles within a project, good modeling skills and quality assurance. \"We are working over each of the issues. Still all of us have a lot of things to do. Now it is easier for us as we see the goal and see the hurdles,\" Anna Stetsenko adds up. Process has long been a problem for most Eastern European companies. The UOF 2006 indicated the positive shift: Ukraine starts to employ the world-recognized practices and methodologies thus becoming more attractive for customers. Customer-oriented model is probably the only way for regional companies to compete with big Kyiv outsourcing service providers having greater staffs and marketing opportunities. TechnoPark Corp. presented their ideas about customer-driven process. Customers' expectations are mainly about quality: quality of process, quality of relationship, quality of deliverables and quality of price. According to the presentation, focusing on these issues must be the main target of regional companies while working over projects. Some practices which have been successfully implemented by some Ukrainian companies were highlighted during the discussion: the establishment of local policy and standards either within a company or within the whole region; internal testing and certification; training for employees; corporate culture. Along with the development process, customers are interested in pricing. Budgets for outsourcing projects in the Ukraine are much lower than those in India, China, Russia and other outsourcing leaders. Recently, head-hunting was on the verge of drawing a price increase. In order to lure high-class engineers away, companies had to offer higher salaries. Thus, the thread of increase of project costs occurred. UOF 2006 assured that customers have nothing to worry about. The idea of creating a HR Ethics Code in order to fight off unfair HR activities was accepted enthusiastically. Forum participants believe that it will help to keep prices down and assure stability of company operations. The Ukraine is no more a dark horse for global outsourcing industry. Since 2000 when the first pilgrims had tried Ukrainian software development services - and some failed, companies have gained much experience in both project implementation and customer relationships. Because of the lack of companies with large staff, the Ukraine is not a country for time-consuming projects. Instead, due to powerful intellectual potential the country is focused on small and medium-size R&D projects. Customers should pay attention to the Ukrainian regional IT outsourcing companies which go overboard to attract business. They have a good chance of becomingcompetitive players in the near future as long as they offer low prices and high quality deliverables.

In fact, PCI DSS is a list of requirements for handling and keeping personal information of payment system clients. Without a doubt, the standard can never fight off the problem back and edge, but the results prove that it really works: according to statistics, no PCI DSS compliant system has been compromised yet. Unfortunately, only 20% of all payment systems in the world have been certified now. Among them, there is only one mobile payment processor; with its certification, MPPS has become the second PCI DSS compliant mobile payment system in the world. MPPS is mobile payment processing system enabling its users to pay for goods and services using only their mobile phones. Like other mobile payment systems, MPPS needs to gather and store its customers' information which includes personal and confidential data. It makes such systems to focus on protection and security of the gathered information. Data security is even more important task in the light of vigorous growth of this young but very prospective industry. High profits make mobile payment industry an attractive target for fraudulent attacks. The PCI Data Security Standards are not an obligatory condition of payment systems operation. Nevertheless, VISA strongly encourages all online payment service providers to go through the certification. PCI DSS requirements cover mostly the piece of software, which operates the system, as this is the crucialfactor providing the service's reliability. Thus, the software developer is responsible for PCI DSS compliance. Software for MPPS was developed by the Ukrainian TechnoPark Corp. The company, together with MPPS Solutions Ltd.'s Management, passed through the certificationprocedures. MPPS applied for the certification in August 2006. In September, the first stage of the certification was held - a so called Onsite Audit. Onsite Audit is the audit held in the company's office. MPPS software as well as documentation were checked and examined by representatives of the British One Sec Ltd. which is the official VISA's auditor. The process took several days. The first stage of theexamination provided a list of comments and needed improvements which had to be implemented during one month. The second stage - Last Clean Scan - was the final examination resulting in overall decision. It was held in October, and the certificate for MPPS was issued on October, 31. Now the company can guarantee high reliability and security of its services to both clients and partners. PCI Data Security Standards have been used for more than 5 years, however there are very few PCI DSS compliant eastern European software companies focused on online payments. Despite many of them are able to offer high-quality products, most IT companies are frustrated by the great efforts, both intellectual and financial, needed to complete the certification. The good news is that some outsourcing software development companies have already realized that the game was worth the candle. With the availability of reliable developers, risk of outsourcing online-payment projects to the Ukraine decreases. The Ukrainian software product's PCI DSS compliance is an important achievement for the whole Ukrainian IT outsourcing industry. TechnoPark Corp. has made the first step towards changing the image of Ukrainian IT products from \"cheap staff\" to \"high-quality and reliable software products\". TechnoPark Corp. is outsourcing software development company with headquarters in the U.S., Naples, Florida, and software development center in the Ukraine, Dnepropetrovsk.

Although internal customers still cannot afford to order large IT projects, Ukrainian IT products are progressively more desired in western countries. The United States and western Europe are unalterably the well-established importers of software development services from the Ukraine. The growth of IT industry export totaled 60% and rose to $280 million in 2006; the growth of IT market totaled 25-30%. According to the IDC forecast, Ukrainian Information Technology market is expected to grow 15-17% and reach $2.4-2.5 million in 2007. This means that the outsourcing service market is going to maintain stable growth. The successful development of Information Technology Outsourcing Industry in the Ukraine results from a number of advantageous factors in the country. Despite the increase in developer's salaries and general price inflation in 2006, software development costs are still highly competitive and attractive for western customers. The attractive prices are accompanied with progressively improving quality of products and knowledge of developers. Still, offering low costs is the priority only for small and medium-sized western companies when they choose outsourcing service provider. These are the kind of customers who will be critical for maintaining Ukrainian IT services export volume in 2007. In order to attract big investors, governmental programs stimulating country's IT industry development and making up positive image of the Ukrainian developers in the world need to be conducted. The majority of U.S. and western European big business owners still consider risks of IT outsourcing to the Ukraine to be very high. Several years are needed to attract them to the country. Nevertheless, small and medium-sized customers are good prospectives. IDC forecasts the increase of small and medium-sized businesses' (SMB) role for providers searching for new markets. Another factor which is expected to contribute to the development of the Ukrainian Information Technology market is the unstable political situation in the Middle East. The permanent threat of war conflicts in the region leads to the surrender of cooperation with the traditional outsourcing market leaders: India, Israel, Pakistani and other Middle Eastern countries. The reallocation of orders will start in the near future, providing Ukraine with a good chance to present itself as a reliable and prospective service provider at the global market level. Because of the political instability in the Middle East, interest from eastern and central European countries has increased. The similarity of cultural code, traditions, and religion are an important advantage for outsourcers to work with the country. U.S. and western European customers like the western mentality Ukrainians offer and small time-zone differences. Thus, a new trend called \"nearshoring\" is a prospective direction for the Ukraine. Nearshoring is an offshore outsourcing to countries situated near the customer's country. It is popular in developed western European countries like Germany. The former USSR republics which include Ukraine are within eyeshot of customers who may start exploiting nearshoring Numerous Information Technology conferences and forums evidence the increased interest to the Ukraine around the globe. Ukrainian Outsourcing Forum, which is one of the most important outsourcing events, has expanded its borders and hosted participants from the U.S., Europe and Asia in 2006.The Ukrainian showcase at the international outsourcing exhibition CeBIT 2006 was another important shift. Due to all of these factors, the Ukraine was included into the five most attractive outsourcing directions for some western countries in 2006. The progress of the IT outsourcing decentralization process is an obvious trend. Regions develop dynamically and compete with the capital, Kiev. It helps to keep prices down along with improving the services quality. Regional companies are traditionally small with the staff of no more than 100 employees, however, these are the companies making up the basis of the Information Technology Industry in the Ukraine, where big players can be counted on the fingers of one hand presently. That is why swiftly developing medium-sized companies determine the development of IT outsourcing industry in the Ukraine now. From TechnoPark Corp. Management, the company's profit has grown by 70% in 2006. TechnoPark Corp. is outsourcing software development company. Software development center is located in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, and company's headquarters is based in the U.S., Florida. Due to the U.S. based office, it is easy for the company to find and contact western clients. A number of successful projects implemented by TechnoPark Corp. evidence that there are mature companies able to provide reliable and stable cooperation in the field of offshore software development outsourcing in the Ukraine. Due to growing interest in the Ukraine, the number of articles devoted to the country as an attractive IT outsourcing direction increase in the U.S. and European mass media. \"The country is quickly becoming a home for offshore development, with outsourcing turnover apparently growing at 200 to 300 per cent annually. Locations that buck the downward trend will provide competitive sourcing solutions for IT directors. Ukraine might well be one of such centres,\" writes British online magazine . A publication devoted to outsourcing to Eastern Europe published at reads that \"The attractive offshore work centers in eastern Europe include Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Belarus and the Baltic. These markets not only offer low cost skilled labor forces, but also an attractive regulatory environment with a close proximity and cultural ties to western Europe.\" The Ukrainian Information Technology Outsourcing Industry will continue growing. Even though experts foresee the general decrease of IT outsourcing needs in the global market, the Ukraine has good chances of fidning its niche and developing outsourcing services due to political stability and great intellectual resources.

This development is stimulated by high intellectual potential derived from the powerful military sector of the USSR, low cost of IT personnel, governmental support, and cultural ties with western Europe. Today, small and medium-sized businesses are major customers of eastern European offshoring companies. Major corporations still hesitate about offshoring software projects to the region, because of the lack of knowledge about the area.

Adopts A New Model Of Software Development Estimation, Delivers Accuracy","url":"/about/news/year2007/news8","date":"2007-05-14 00:00:00 +0000","categories":[],"body":"In March 2007, a modified Cocomo II model went into operation at TechnoPark Corp. Read on to learn more on the secrets of effective project estimation as revealed by this successful U.S.-based outsourcing software development firm. Pre-sales estimation of project costs and durations has been a software dilemma that started with the profession itself. Despite all good intentions, Murphy's Law seems to leave everyone room to be unhappy about something. Customers expect accuracy and often are disappointed even by what software companies consider minor post-sales adjustments. IT project managers dread giving pre-sales estimates because they know that just about every project has hidden work. The burning question has been, \"Is it possible to make an accurate estimation before the project architecture is built?\" The dream answer of \"YES\" is all the more desirable for outsourcing software firms, such as TechnoPark Corp., because accuracy is also related to trust and reputation, the cornerstone qualities of any outsourcing company. Since the 1970s, there have been many attempts to attain this dream of accurate pre-sales estimations of projects. None, however, have stood up to the rigors of real world challenges and client expectations. Today, TechnoPark Corp. shares its successful experience in the fine art of pre-sales estimation. First, let's review the basis of the estimation process. There are some common mistakes and some important issues ignored by many estimators. A common initial mistake by software development companies is that they estimate the project as if everything will go \"just right.\" However, it will not. It is best to estimate the reality of the process, and not a scenario. Risks ought to be the first things analyzed. Any estimation not based on analysis of all probable risks, in conjunction with a company's true capabilities, inevitably will result in an estimation of one's hopes and wishes and not probability. According to the new model by TechnoPark Corp. a requirements-based model is the most suitable for pre-sales estimation. The source lines of code (SLOC) model, popular in the 1980s-90s, proves to not be effective any longer as coding is significantly more complex and interactive than the number of lines of a program. The SLOC model admittedly still helps with measuring the efforts of a completed project, but that doesn't help much with estimating before the coding begins. Requirements-based estimation, on the other hand, accounts in advance for a project's features, risks and complexity. Analysis of the requirements provides an estimator with a more abstract but accurate vision, as the estimator views the whole project. Requirements-based estimation however is not the solution either according to the new model by TechnoPark Corp. Pre-sales estimation needs a general understanding of the project but also needs to account for the details, an area where requirements-based modeling comes up short. Another golden rule of estimating reads: Estimate the range, not the precise figure. It usually is impossible to count the precise size of efforts and get a correct estimation in the pre-sale phase. It is better to estimate the spectrum of possibilities and set aside more precise estimation for the detailed examination of the project. In order to get the range, three figures for each task are needed: Worst Case (WC) is the maximum amount of staff-hours needed to implement the feature and depicts the situation when everything is going wrong; Best Case (BC) is an optimistic estimation providing minimum amount of staff-hours; and Most Likely (ML) depicts the situation which is the most probable in an estimators' assessment, which may be close to either the worst or best case. \"At TechnoPark Corp., we involve three developers each time estimation is facilitated. Two of them provide their versions of WC, BC and ML estimations, and the third one estimates complexity and function points. When counting the range of staff-hours, we use a number of additional coefficients such as maturity of process, required software reliability, programming language experience, etcetera. After all necessary data are entered, automated counting is implemented by the system based on COCOMO II\", explains Victoria Malinovskaya, the estimation facilitator at TechnoPark Corp. , is growing in popularity as an estimation model. Its first version, COCOMO 81, was introduced in 1981 by Barry Boehm. The model is used for estimating the number of staff-hours and months it will take to develop a software product. The first version was based on SLOC counting. COCOMO II appeared in the 1990s. The power behind COCOMO II is that it is based on function points instead of SLOC. A function point is a rough estimate of a unit of delivered functionality of a software project. To calculate the number of function points for a software project, one counts all of the user inputs, user outputs, user inquiries, number of files and number of external interfaces, dividing them all into simple, average and complex categories. COCOMO II coefficients and formulas are clear and useful for software development companies, both big and small. The model offered by TechnoPark Corp. is based on COCOMO II with only small fluctuations making it more suitable for outsourcing software development companies. TechnoPark Corp. has adapted the COCOMO II approach to client costing with great success. \"With COCOMO II, we have helped the company reduce losses caused by understated estimations by almost 70%,\" Malinovskaya said.

The conservative business element of Europe is more likely to choose \"nearshoring\" instead of \"offshoring\" when it comes to contracting out web development needs, TechnoPark has found. With a wide choice of providers located geographically close to their countries, western European businesses generally prefer nearsourcing their IT projects to central and eastern Europe. TechnoPark's proven history and U.S. division gives it a distinct advantage over the emerging software outsourcing destinations of Hungary, Romania, Czech Republic, Belarus, Russia and even its home in the Ukraine. TechnoPark has isolated three practical reasons why western European businesses choose the firm for nearshoring: Cultural proximity . Ukraine's religious and mental ties to western Europe are historical. Time-zone proximity . There is only a one hour difference between timezones in the Ukraine and Germany. The difference is the same with most western European locations. Geographical proximity . Ukraine is a maximum three hour flight from any European country, and there are direct flights from most countries. \"We chose to start a German division because we have already had successful experiences implementing projects for German clients,\" explains Egor Bougaenko, CEO of TechnoPark Corp. \"We feel that Germany is a good market, so we want to address German businesses in their language.\" For more information on the German division of TechnoPark Corp. visit www.technoparkcorp.com .

In order to pay for some service, the Customer sends SMS to the Provider's number and receives a digital access code to his phone. At this moment, the Customer's phone bill is charged and the money is transferred to the Provider's account. This payment style is ideal for so-called \"micro-payments\". TechnoPark Corp. is developing a premium SMS management platform for Dialect Properties LLC., a Texas-based company, since 2006. The product is branded by MsgWire.com label on the US market. \"This project challenged our team, since it had a number of serious and unforeseen risks caused by connectivity with third-parties and the necessity to perform functional testing remotely\" - says Arthur Petrenko, Marketing Director of TechnoPark Corp. The mobile market has tremendously grown just in a few years. Premium SMS billing is also constantly rising and now has a significant share of the whole mobile market in the USA. The first ever Premium SMS Report, that was presented by Telephia, have shown that Premium SMS sales in Q1 2007 were about $273 million. Most of this revenue was as payment for mobile content and voting/sweepstakes entries. The reason for such PSMS popularity lies in the fact that it is a very successful way to reach the Customer. The field of premium messaging became the field for marketing experiments due to extremely high coverage. As an example, NBC's 'Deal or No Deal' became a real premium SMS hit and generated nearly half of the volume and revenue of voting/sweepstakes entries in the first quarter of 2007. \"The new version of the system is making our plans of licensing very possible now. We will be able to deliver flexible, stable and powerful products. We already have a number of requests from future license-holders, who will buy the platform this summer with an annual flat fee\" - says Vonn Butler, CEO of Dialect Properties LLC. The newest version of MsgWire.com was released this March. The system is integrated with MX Telecom and OpenMarket XML gateways, thus reaching more than 98% of US mobile phone users.

It has been a Mobile Marketing Association (MMA) Consumer Best Practices Committee member from 2005 and was two times named in the top twenty of the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 and led this rank in 2006.

In an age where internet use can reveal information like IP addresses, specific preferences on a website, sites last visited, and home addresses, customers want reassurance that their information will not be used for spam or for criminal purposes.

When a client is sharing trade secrets, source code, and innovative ideas, they need to be absolutely sure their vendor is reliable. BBB Certificate Continuing their effort to provide customer reassurance and quality procedures, TechnoPark Corp. (TPC) has announced that they are the proud holder of a BBB Online Seal . The five-month long process to qualify for the seal involved three staff members from the US and the Ukraine. In the end, TechnoPark Corp. developed a Privacy Policy that is now displayed on their website. The BBB Online Seal confirms a company is an accredited business in the BBB where they are based. The seal confirms a company has met truth in advertising guidelines, discloses information about the business and its policies, follows basic privacy and security practices, and responds appropriately to problems that arise. The BBB was founded in 1912 and there are now 128 BBB offices in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Customers rely on the BBB's independent judgment when they seek both vendors and business associates. TechnoPark Corp. sought the BBB Online Seal because they are a custom software development company with employees and clients that live all over the world. They specialize in project managing software development services. During a project they do time scheduling, risk-management, quality assurance and control, staffing, scope management and communications. Their product guarantees a project will be done on deadline and under budget. When working on a project, TechnoPark Corp. uses a virtual team of experts, including software architects, programmers, test analysts, testers, graphic artists, technical writers, deployment managers, system administrators, and quality and technical reviewers. Responsibilities of each team member are very specific and relevant to his or her experience, certifications and skills. The very nature of using virtual teams requires precise security procedures. TechnoPark Corp. uses the best people from around the world, but in order to make sure sensitive information stays safe, TPC has streamlined their security measures and has invested in independent monitors to guarantee their product. Just like TechnoPark Corp., world-renowned companies like The Boston Herald, PNC Bank, and Dell, Inc all take time to go through certification with the Better Business Bureau. In general, being associated with the Better Business Bureau means a company is willing to meet at least thirteen minimum requirements, including fulfilling licensing requirements, submitting background information, agreeing to use BBB arbitration, and maintaining clear customer service guidelines. The BBB operates to create a community of trustworthy businesses, they set standards for marketplace trust and they denounce substandard marketplace behavior. TechnoPark Corp. hasn't stopped their third party certifications with the BBB Online Seal. They plan to obtain ISO 27001 certification by the end of 2008. This certification is intended to provide the foundation for a third party audit. The most international organization in the world knows the importance of being ISO 27001 certified. In 2006, the United Nations Secretariat achieved certification. To ensure ISO 27001 standards, an independent certification organization evaluates a prospective company. A six step process is common to most certifying bodies. The certification body asks for the company to complete a questionnaire, an application for assessment is filled out, a pre-assessment visit is made to the premises, documents are reviewed in an audit, then compliance is audited, and finally there are ongoing audits to ensure that standards stay current. Arthur Petrenko, TechnoPark Corp.'s Marketing Director, said, \"We're proud of the BBB Online Seal. It was a five-month long process, and it represents our quest to operate ethically and provide a safe environment for our customers. We're also looking forward to ISO 27001 certification at the end of the year. Our regular customers know they can rely on us, but we often spend some time convincing new clients to accept an offshore software development company. ISO 27001 eases minds and allows us to do what we're best at, delivering software projects on time and within a reasonable budget.\" Finally, in January 2008, TechnoPark Corp. also verified that they meet industry standards for protecting their customer's rights and their customer's personal information by qualifying for the TRUSTe seal they display on their website.

It is illegal for a U.S. citizen to transfer funds to pay for online poker, and this includes the use of credit cards online. Poker providers have had to change their business model to conform to these laws. Instead of placing money on the outcome of a poker game, with the TechnoPark GS-Poker software solution, U.S. customers will be able to sign up for memberships and play poker for fun. There will be cash bonuses for some of the luckiest players at the end of the monthly game play. However, no money will be rewarded for individual games. Online Gaming is extremely popular throughout the world. Creating a membership model for online gaming could help poker companies tap into some staggering earning opportunities. In 2007, people living in Norway spent an estimated 961 million Euros while gambling online. United States citizens spent about 84.65 billion dollars on Internet gambling annually before a ban was enacted in 2006. Since 2006, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) has prevented U.S. citizens from transferring funds to an Internet gambling institution. Fantasy Sports, online lotteries and horse races are exceptions to this law. They continue to be permitted. Memberships for playing poker online are lawful as long as a client is simply playing the game, not betting money on the result of a particular hand of cards. Online Poker was always a challenge in the United States. One company, Betfair, claims it had long avoided the U.S market, so when the UIGEA legislation passed, Betfair didn't suffer a large economic downturn. Unfortunately, many companies did suffer. After 2006, many online gaming companies had to rethink their U.S. market strategy. Some companies, like Bodog.com Entertainment, essentially abandoned its U.S. gaming-related advertising and decided to focus on the lucrative European audience. For those poker companies still looking to work with U.S. customers, following the laws, creating technology to allow game play, and attracting an interested audience has been a huge challenge. In order to remain within the boundaries of U.S. law, some poker companies have set up poker \"schools\". Other sites offer poker videos and a chance to mingle with poker celebrities. TechnoPark Corp. has used their technical expertise and skilled project management procedures to work with the gaming industry to solve this complex situation. TechnoPark Corp. has allowed gaming companies to make a transition from gambling to attracting customers to play poker online for a monthly fee. They have set up the technology to create licenses, charge monthly fees, and install the payment software on a gaming client's servers. They welcome other gaming companies to inquire about their membership software procedure, as TechnoPark Corp. can help bring profits to struggling online websites. In response to TechnoPark Corp.'s gaming software, a recent client said this, \"\"The software product has over 2 million lines of code and has been in development since 2001. It will be a challenging task for their software architects and programmers to change the business model and keep the product stable, while continuing to keep the total cost of this migration on budget.\" TechoPark Corp. has been developing these gaming tools over time. They are poised to usher in a new type of online poker industry. Arthur Petrenko, TechnoPark Corp.'s Marketing Director, said, \"It's a pleasure to help U.S. customers and international gaming organizations find a legal way to meet and create an online poker playing society. We are going to finish the development of the beta-version of this new platform before the end of September, 2008.\" TechnoPark Corp. is a US-based outsourcing software development company with development centers across the globe, including the Ukraine, India and China.

Apache Continuum version 1.2 allows TechnoPark Corp. to keep an eye on the details of intricate coding within the projects TechnoPark Corp. manages. Continuous integration helps TechnoPark Corp. to be more efficient with their time when it comes to coding. When developers have an early warning system to detect faulty code, they spend less time trouble shooting and more time creating useful solutions for their clients. Apache Continuum helps developers and teams to improve and maintain quality when they build their project. Apache Continuum notifies developers when they have created incompatible code or if something they built is broken. Continuous integration is an automated system that monitors code for errors. One of the advantages of an automated system is that it requires its user to be organized. The system uses a developer's records and processes to monitor the creation of code. If a developer inputs the wrong information, the automated system won't work. This is useful because when a developer is creating large quantities of code, they could be unaware of a small error that will disable the whole project. Without an automated system, a project could be near completion before bugs were discovered. With continuous integration, small errors are caught early at a point when they are easier to correct. This also saves the time of having to hunt for tiny problems in vast amounts of code. Authors Martin Fowler and Kent Beck first wrote about continuous integration for the programming community in the late 1990's. One continuous integration provider, CruiseControl, now employs Martin Fowler through its parent company, Thoughtworks.

This invention greatly reduces the time it takes to provide an estimate to a client. The estimates are more accurate, which in turn helps clients plan for the on-deadline completion of a project. Using uniquely developed formulas, TechnoPark uses a limited number of examples in a client's code to calculate the time it will take a programmer to build a project. By using the most complex examples of code, TechnoPark Corp.'s invention defines the amount of effort needed to complete a software product. The technical explanation of the new invention deals with sets of requirements. Based on a limited set, up to seven, the requirements, existing on the same level of abstraction, are estimated with an existing estimation approach. The requirements, called scope champions, are chosen for their complexity and then calculated for the time it takes to complete them. Until TechnoPark Corp. pioneered these formulas, programmers often had to expend a great deal of time to provide a reasonably accurate estimate. This was detrimental to client and vendor alike. Vendors don't want to waste hours estimating when they could be working billable hours. Clients are more satisfied when their projects are done on time and under budget. TechnoPark Corp.'s invention gives it an edge when estimates are made because customers know they can count on a well researched, proven estimating technique. Arthur Petrenko, TechnoPark Corp.'s Marketing Director, says, \"We have been working on new inventions like the estimation formula to benefit our clients. In the future, we are going to continue to develop and patent our ideas and methods. This is all part of our larger dedication to excellence and reliable business practices.\" USPTO issued an application number for TechnoPark, , and they are excited to announce the invention.

To ensure the quality of their process, TPC created an original procedure that includes a quality requirements definition, quality metrics collection, numeric calculations and methods for team motivation. By calculating requirement weights, TPC has created software called \"thePanel\" which allows software developers to accurately predict the quality of their process. Once the necessary calculations are made, they are delivered to project managers, senior managers and project stakeholders. Says Arthur Petrenko, TechnoPark Corp.'s Marketing Director, \"This method and automated process is at the core of our business. It gives us an advantage and allows us to be unique in the quality we provide to our customers. Our invention makes us the only company in the market offering an automated quality of process calculation through the entire software project. By delivering a dependable prediction of the quality of process, all parties involved in a project understand the end goal and how everyone will work together to achieve that end goal. The approach works for individual projects and for businesses trying to maintain multiple processes. The method for measuring quality of process has already helped TPC save 10-40% on their costs and increased team motivation in 10 projects during 2008. The application to the USPTO was filed on November 4th 2008 and has a pending number of 12/264,370. This method is going to be patented by the European Patent Office (EPO) next year. Submitting the Quality of Process patent to the US Patent and Trademark Office follows a series of steps over the past year that TPC has taken to fortify their reputation with their clients and to secure their intellectual property. These steps include pending patents and achieving ISO 9001:2000 certification. TechnoPark Corp. is a US-based outsourcing software development company with development centers across the globe, including the Ukraine, India and China.

Being a customer in such a project, how do you monitor and control the without programming skills? If the answer is \"I trust my programmers\" you may suffer from some of the following problems: You are afraid to change key programmers since each of them possesses some unique knowledge about your product; You can only hope that your code is of good quality because your coders say it is; You can't add new features freely since the product becomes unstable after every new change; You feel that if you want to get higher quality-of-code you have to change programmers. These problems occur in many projects where the quality-of-code is not controlled and is not managed. A common assumption is that good programmers produce good code and if you want to improve the code you should hire better programmers. This assumption is wrong. Quality-of-code in your product has to be controlled by you and now we will show you how to accomplish this. What are your objectives? Programmers (coders, testers, analysts) are technical specialists whose motivation is based on . Either you recognize them as \"gurus\" or their colleagues give them respect for their knowledge or experience, it is better if they receive both. Unfortunately, in most cases money is not the first priority for them. In order to earn and retain the status of \"guru\" a programmer has to do something that no one else can do. He or she must know the tricks in your software. After all, the more complex the software is the higher their salary will be. However, your objectives are different. Your business value is , and you want to invest into it, not into programmers. You want to control it and you want to know that the product really belongs to you, not to the people who know the tricks. As you see, your objectives and your coders' objectives are not aligned, in other words you work against each other. Quality-of-code could be measured To align objectives and start sharing common goals, it is necessary to invent a that will represent your objective and at the same time will impact the programmers' motivation. The higher the metric, the better the quality-of-code will be. At the same time, the benefits for programmers will be higher, like salary and recognition. We use two metrics: Code Coverage and Cyclomatic Complexity . Each of them are calculated automatically at each round of continuous integration . tells you that the code is clear and simple and could be easily understood by new programmers (This means no more \"tricks\"). Cyclomatic complexity is one of the most important software metrics used in static code analysis . tells you that for each block of code there exists a unit test that validates it. The biggest benefit of unit tests is that once the code is tested it stays workable when its author forgets how it works. In our management panel you get a graph that indicates current value of the metric and a history of change, like you see in the sample below: This graph is available for you and your coders. It is instantly updated by our software according to the source code from SVN repository. How we do this technically There are five components of the whole process: SVN , Continuum , Maven2 , Gist and thePanel. Coders as usualy commit their changes to SVN, and you monitor quality-of-code in our online project management system (thePanel): The cycle is repeated every day and is initiated by Continuum, an open-source continuous integration software by Apache Group : Coders commit changes to the SVN repository Continuum checks out the changes and starts the builder (Maven2) Maven2 compiles the code and runs unit tests JUnit -like framework produces a code coverage report A language-specific tool calculates cyclomatic complexity The transmitter (Gist) sends XML report to thePanel thePanel converts metrics into bonuses , for coders You get the quality-of-code instantly This process is absolutely transparent for you and the coders. Everything below the dotted red line in the diagram above is not visible to anyone. Coders commit changes to SVN together with unit tests and get feedback in form of bonuses. You monitor the values of metrics. We use our own simple cyclomatic complexity calculator based on Thomas McCabe's principles. Code coverage is calculated by JUnit , xdebug .

Customers don't have enough programming skills and spare time to check the quality-of-code regularly. Programmers don't think too much about quality since the customer is far away. As a result, quality-of-code is out of the customer's control. There are four severe symptoms of such a situation: You are afraid to change key programmers since each of them possesses some unique knowledge about your product; You can only hope that your code is of good quality because your coders say it is; You can't add new features freely since the product becomes unstable after every new change; You feel that if you want to get higher quality-of-code you have to change programmers. TechnoPark Corp. has developed a solution that returns control over quality-of-code to the customer's hands. Special software built into a continuous integration cycle collects the two most-valuable source code metrics (Code Coverage and Cyclomatic Complexity) and converts their values into bonuses for programmers. By doing this regularly and automatically, the customer and the project team get a unique level of control over quality-of-code. More details about the method are available on the TechnoPark Corp website at www.technoparkcorp.com . The method can be implemented in new projects managed by TechnoPark Corp and in currently running projects where TechnoPark Corp might play a role as the project management contractor.

"},{"title":"Planning Of Software Bugs","url":"/innovations/test-planning","date":"2009-04-26 00:00:00 +0000","categories":[],"body":"You won't build a quality software product if your mindset is as follows: I release the product when quality testers give the okay The software quality is validated by testers High quality means complete lack of bugs The above statements are common for testers, programmers and project sponsors. During the last 40 years, software books have told us that the assumptions above are the biggest software problems themselves, but software teams still operate under these assumptions. Iterative Testing is Different, Upside Down First, there are a number of critical axioms that you as a project sponsor or project manager must remember: Axiom 1 : Any software product has an unlimited number of bugs not discovered yet In other words you can't control number of bugs in the software they are unlimited. You can only control the number of bugs you discover, which is dependant on the limit of your time and resources. Axiom 2 : Quality is the degree to which a set of characteristics fulfills requirements Quality shows how good your product is compared to your initial expectations. In combining these two axioms we can say that the software product will be \"better\" when you find and fix more bugs. The characteristics are the number of fixed bugs, while requirements are the number of bugs anticipated. Formally, Quality of Implementation ( QoI ) is a relation between the number of fixed bugs ( F ) and number of bugs anticipated ( P ): Quality of Product ( QoP ) is a relationship between the number of bugs anticipated to be discovered ( P ) and the product size ( S ) multiplied by a nominal number of bugs per size unit ( k ). The more bugs you anticipate you will discover, the larger your testing budget, the more time you need, and the higher you Quality of Product. When you say \" I want to create a quality product \" it means that you are planning to develop the software and to find/fix more bugs than usual leading to a QoP higher than usual. For example the product specification will have 100 functional requirements. Usually, your testers find 5 bugs per one functional requirement, spending 0.5 man-hours per one bug (250 totall man-hours). \"Software of higher quality\" will mean, for example, 10 bugs per one requirement, and 1000 bugs in the entire product. This will require additional budget and may increase the average cost of one bug, this will honestly mean that you're planning to create \"a product of higher quality\". When you say \" the software is properly tested \" it means that your testers discovered all the bugs you anticipated discovering and that programmers fixed the majority of them. If you anticipated finding 1000 bugs, and you found 900 while 100 of them remained unfixed, then the Quality of Implementation is 80\\%. Now let's review the assumptions listed above. I release the product when my quality testers give the okay (wrong). Testers are not performing quality control, they are discovering bugs. Testers don't know how this process affects your judgment about product release. You release the product to the market when you think the QoI/QoP is sufficient. The software quality is validated by testers (wrong). The testers's job is to discover bugs. They don't control the QoI or QoP — a project manager plans Quality of Product (QoP) and programmers reach Quality of Implementation (QoI). Testers create inputs (bugs) for programmers. High quality means a complete lack of bugs (wrong). The more bugs you are anticipating to discover, the higher the Quality of Product you are going to achieve. The more bugs you discover and fix, the higher the Quality of Implementation. When the team reports to you that there have been no bugs found, you know that the project has been poorly planned and testing poorly performed. How to Estimate Number of Bugs? The most common question is how can we estimate the number of bugs to be found in the product? The answers are expert judgment, historical information, and prototyping. Remember, that you may always change this number during the course of project. After all, we do this iteratively, don't we? You anticipate the number of bugs according to your own judgment. It's good to start with something like (this is k in the formula above): bugs per line of code bugs per functional requirement bugs per class/method/module bugs per web page You can create your own metrics. Your first priority is to anticipate the number of bugs and your second priority is to anticipate it correctly. How to Estimate Discovery Time for Bugs? Do this in the same manner in which your programmers estimate their time. Testing is the same process as programming and any other engineering task. Before the next iteration quality tester receives the SRS, the list of functional requirements to be tested in a particular iteration, the required numbers of bugs to be detected should be decided and a time estimate — how much time will it take him/her to discover the required number of bugs — to be produced. If the answer is I don't know how many bugs this functionality has , refer him/her to Axiom 1. Conclusion or What Do You Do Next Bugs have to be anticipated the same way as you plan new features and new releases. You have to plan your quality and control it during the entire project. Your plan may fall wide of the mark in the beginning of the project, you may underestimate testing efforts, and your important assumptions may be incorrect. But the biggest mistake you could make is not to anticipate bugs at all.

This paper highlights the proprietary method behind TechnoPark Corp.'s software that uses a new revolutionary approach to software project cost estimating. Rather than estimating the entire project scope, Arthur Petrenko, TechnoPark's Marketing Director, explains that the \"method estimates a very limited number of selective elements called Scope Champions, rather that trying to estimate the entire project. Then a formula is applied to calculate the total cost. Clients find this method saves time and improves accuracy of the estimate.\" While TechnoPark applied for the method's patent last fall, Bougaenko decided to wait for the conference to unveil the process in order \"to take advantage of PROFES' industry reach, as the number and breadth of companies there showcases companies' need for and commitment to the process improvement of software development, a sphere in which TechnoPark and its innovations excel,\" mentions Petrenko. Non-attendees who wish to examine Bougaenko's paper will be able to do so when TechnoPark publishes the article along with presentation slides on TechnoPark's website immediately following the conference.

Materials of the conference are published by Springer Verlag. The method is pending USPTO patent: 12/193,010 . Any project needs estimates (cost, time and resource) as key artifacts, which are based on scope definition. There are many well-established and proven methods of software size and cost estimating, which are based on software specifications and organizational assets, e.g. historical data. In a general case, any method includes (i) requirements analysis, (ii) numbers deriving and (iii) final calculation. These three steps could be repeated several times iteratively, e.g. like in Wideband Delphi . Each step may be completed manually or with a special tool and/or algorithm, e.g. function point analysis , COCOMO , PERT , XP user stories , SLOC prediction, by analogies, with use case points , class points, neural networks, and others. No matter what tools and algorithms are used, the whole process has two significant disadvantages, which very often make it difficult to achieve optimal results or even to finish the estimating in time. First, even a mid-size software project may contain hundreds of functional and non-functional requirements. The time required by estimators for proper understanding and analysis of requirements almost always is much bigger than the budgeted time for the whole estimating process. The obvious outcome of this situation is a limited understanding of requirements by estimators, which leads to inaccuracy in the estimators' judgement. Second, estimators tend to approximate the numbers. With a big amount of small estimates, this leads to a certain deviation in the final calculation (either to the higher or to the lower boundary of the approximation). The deviation grows much faster than the amount of the estimates does. A good solution to the outlined problems is our innovative method that decreases the amount of efforts required for deriving numbers, at the same time improving the accuracy of the estimate. The Method of Scope Champions In properly managed software projects, product scope is defined by software requirements specification (SRS), that includes functional and non-functional requirements to the product. A numbered list of requirements defines the boundary of the product scope, while non-functional requirements supplement them with quality attributes. The method consists of three steps: 1) select Scope Champions , 2) estimate Scope Champions, and 3) calculate the product scope estimate. Scope Champion is a selected functional requirement, the biggest and the most complex element of scope, according to the estimators' expert judgement. Scope Champions are picked up from a complete set of requirements on the same level of abstraction. When Scope Champions are selected, isolated estimates for them are made by estimators. Using the estimates and the formula, proposed as part of this method, the final product scope estimate is calculated. The formula is: Where Y are estimates of Scope Champions, m is a total amount of Scope Champions, and n is the total amount of functional requirements in SRS. Y is a final product scope estimate. Accuracy of the final estimate is improved because: the estimators judgement is based on more detailed analysis, and the final estimate is much easier to validate and review. The method can be used with other scope-defining artifacts, i.e. use case models, software architecture, design model, test plan, and others. The results obtained should be applied together, which will give higher accuracy for the total.

Materials of the conference will be published by Springer Verlag. One of the most important \"process area\" in project management is risk management, which includes risk planning, risk identification, qualitative and quantitative analysis, risk response planning and risk monitoring. The risk identification process provides the material for risk analysis and risk response planning. A raw list of risks, that shall include hundreds of them, can be generated by different methods, including brainstorming, historical records, checklists and templates, risk charting, objectives-based, scenario-based, taxonomy-based, conduct a \"pre-mortem\", Affinity Diagrams, Delphi technique, expert interviews, Nominal Group Technique, and others. Every method has its own advantages and drawbacks. However, any of them when applied to a project with the following constraints, will fail to produce a required result: a) project team is multi-lingual and distributed (online text chats only), b) risk identification meetings must take less than one hour, c) meetings are held regularly (every iteration), and d) each meeting shall produce at least a hundred risks. Existing methods will fail in these circumstances because of (most common causes): a) Inattention; b) Language barriers; c) Unavoidable personal criticism; d) Weariness after repeating meetings; and e) Untrained risk identifiers. A good solution to the outlined problems could be a method that will reduce the amount of efforts required for risk identification, at the same time increasing personnel engagement and motivation. Method The purpose of this method is to increase the effectiveness of risk identification meetings in software development projects, reduce the time and effort required for the meetings and make the meetings possible to be held in online text chat form. The meeting facilitator prepares and presents to the meeting participants the list of five key project objectives and a list of risk sources (up to dozen). The objectives go horizontally, while risk sources vertically. The matrix becomes a field for the Risk Game. The rules of the Risk Game are: Facilitator announces the next row (risk source); Everyone invents risks for the given risk source; Facilitator chooses the winner for the row; Matrix gets the name of the winner in a corresponding cell; The person who has the most cells wins the game. The meeting recorder maintains the list of all invented risks. This list is passed to the facilitator by the end of the meeting. The result of the Risk Game is a long list of raw unsorted risks, which will be used by the project management for quantitative and qualitative risk analysis. The proposed method is more effective than other existing methods when meeting time is limited (less than one hour) and a big list of risks is required (more than a hundred). The method is more effective in such circumstances because it quickly involves everybody in the process, converts individual criticism into a fair competition and stimulates group thinking.

The method detailed in the paper Bougaenko will present had its genesis last summer in a large, risky project for one German customer. Since none of the methods to identify project risks were suitable for the online-chat environment needed by its distributed team, TechnoPark developed its own method. The paper is especially relevant to this year's SEAFOOD theme, \"Enabling Global Partnerships to Deliver on Business Needs,\" as it is specifically tailored to instances where, among other factors, the project team is multi-lingual and distributed. However, in line with TechnoPark's efforts to \"create value for all companies, the method is appropriate even for mono-lingual teams in a concentrated location,\" mentions Bougaenko. \"Since project management is a difficult discipline, while risk management is especially so, TechnoPark aims to simplify complex things, ensuring success in our customers' projects through professional project management. This method is an excellent example of our latest research in this direction,\" says Arthur Petrenko, TechnoPark's Marketing Director. \"In fact, this method resulted in a savings of over 200 man-hours and more than 9% of budget on the very first project we deployed it on,\" adds Petrenko. Interested parties can obtain the conference materials from TechnoPark Corp., who will make them available for download on its website right after the end of the conference.

Unit tests plus continuous integration give you a guarantee that most of your source code defects will be caught before they reach end users. Unit tests verify the code beforehand and a continuous integration server informs you if a defect is found, right before deployment. It's a proven mechanism used in the majority of products striving for quality. But who can guarantee that if a defect is found after deployment it is reported immediately before disappointed end users find it? Integration tests can effectively do this. To be short, \"Integration Testing\" is similar to unit testing, however the testing subject is not the software itself, but its deployment environment. With integration tests, you're verifying whether your product is located in a comfortable place and is ready for end users. Unit tests verify your product one-by-one, where integration tests verify you one-by-one. Sound weird? This article explains the concept and its implementation in , the open-source framework. framework is written in PHP, but can be used for the integration testing of products written in any other web-oriented language, including Java, Python, Ruby, etc. Let's start with a simple example. Imagine you developed a web-system and prepared it for delivery to your customer. You created complete and detailed installation instructions where you explained the requirements to the server-side system software configuration. Despite your efforts, very soon you receive a complaint from the customer: \"The system is full of bugs and we can't make it work!\" But you know for sure that the product is properly tested and works on your local machine. You understand that the problem is in the installation, within the customer's server environment. How do you explain to the customer where the problem is and how to fix it? One option is to do the work yourself. Ask the customer for root access to the server, debug the software there, find the problems, fix them, and make the customer happy. This solution is very common, but is also a very costly and risky method. First, you don't know how much time this procedure might take. Second, you might unintentionally break other products on the same server. Third, you will become responsible for the server and this installation forever. Fourth, ...the list of possible problems is endless. The bottom line is that this manual approach, although very common, is the worst option. Integration tests are a great alternative. You create small supplementary software modules (called \"\") that are executed on the production server and validate critical environment parameters. For example: version of PHP, availability of PHP extensions, version of MySQL, database access permissions, accessibility of network ports, read/write access permissions of log files and directories, etc. (Some of my products have 50 or more different integration tests). In addition to the integration tests, you need software that will start all of them together and report a summary result in a user-friendly format. Then, you can show this report to the customer, indicating the problems with the server. Once they are fixed, your product works as if it is being installed on your local machine. Easy! simplifies this work, and lets you write integration tests fast and easy. is the first unique product of its kind. is a free open-source product.

Distributed software development is rapidly becoming the norm for technology companies. The ability of a company to successfully carry out its tasks depends on the appropriate combination of organizational structure, processes, and collaborative tools. Recent studies show that existing collaborative software tools are used mostly as \"shared repositories\", while discussions take place outside of the tool in e-mails, chats or phone calls. Consider an example where a programmer was assigned to implement a new software function. He created a new separate version control \"branch\", and was aware of \"continuous integration\" principle advocated in the project. The implementation was planned to take a few days, but he faced a few problems and raised a number of questions during development. Once his questions were answered and the branch was ready for integration with the main stream, he realized that the main stream received a number of important changes. Synchronization of the branch with the main stream took some time, and produced new questions and problems. After a number of such synchronization iterations, the branch was considered as out-dated and was closed. The example illustrates a \"delayed branch\" problem, which does not have a solution in existing software development methodologies. There are a number of possible workarounds, including: a) breaking the principle of continuous integration and merging of a \"broken\" branch with the main stream; b) closing the branch after the first problem or question, in order to minimize time and cost losses; or c) pausing the branch and hoping for the best. None of these workarounds really solve the problem. However, a solution is needed because its absence can effectively ruin the development of an enterprise project, especially if the team is remotely distributed. Summary The invented \"PDD\" includes a specific method and software that resolves the problem of \"delayed branches\" conflict in concurrent distributed software development, and in many other types of software development projects. Every time a developer is working with a branch and sees a problem or a question that needs the participation of another programmer, he implements a temporary solution that keeps the code compilable. He marks the place in the code with @todo tag (called \"puzzle\") and merges the branch into trunk . The \"puzzle\" includes the identifier of a task he was working with. As long as the \"puzzle\" stays in source code, a project manager considers the task as incomplete and pending resolution. The project manager assigns \"puzzle\" resolution to other team members. When all \"puzzles\" are resolved, the project manager returns the task back to the programmer, asking him to continue with development. The key advantage of the PDD method, comparing with all other known approaches, is the absence of long branches. Implementation of every task, no matter how difficult it is, takes a few hours in one iteration. Then the task is set to pending state and new \"puzzles\" are merged into trunk . Project planning becomes more predictable and simple, since the project manager is dealing with a large amount of small isolated tasks, instead of long and risky activities. With this method, cost and scope control also becomes more effective. Properly used \"puzzles\" becomes the main management and communication mechanism in a distributed software project, replacing e-mails, online discussions and phone calls. Moreover, the PDD software collects \"puzzles\" from source code and builds short-term plans of key development tasks. Example The diagram compares two approaches visually explaining source code repository changes and merges. Workflow A uses PDD concept and creates three branches during the development of the feature. Workflow B uses a \"delayed branch\" approach and creates just one branch during the development of the same feature. The picture clearly indicates that Workflow B has much higher risk of conflict during branch merging with the trunk . Workflow B in details (the workflow is a simplified example of a real-life software project): The source code repository is in revision 1 , and the programmer receives a task from the project manager and starts a new branch in order to implement it. The programmer makes initial implementation and commits changes with 2 . Suddenly, the programmer understands that he does not have enough information in order to complete the task, so he asks the project manager for help. The project manager decides that the architect should be helpful in this situation and forwards the request to him. Once the answer is ready, the programmer receives it (by e-mail). According to the information received, the programmer makes his next commit to the repository. While the programmer was waiting for the answer, the repository received two changes from other team members, in revisions 3 and 4 . Thus, the programmer commits his changes in revision 5 . Now, the feature is almost finished and only one final change has to be done before returning it back to the trunk . The programmer makes that change and commits it to the repository, in revision 7 . The project manager is notified about the finished feature and merges the branch into the trunk in 9 . Revisions 7 and 8 were committed to the repository by other project team members. The distance between merging the branch into the trunk and starting the branch is 7 revisions. To the contrary, Workflow A looks differently: The repository is in revision 1 and the programmer makes her first changes in 2 (similar to Workflow B). Now the programmer understands the necessity of additional information and refers to the project manager. The programmer makes the branch ready for merging into trunk by means of \"stubs\" and properly commented places, which are not implemented yet. The project manager merges the branch into trunk in revision 5 (the distance is 2 revisions and the risk of conflict is much lower than in Workflow B). The project manager decides who is going to resolve the question asked by the programmer, finds the right person, assigns this problem to him and waits for the answer. The answer comes in a new branch, revision 7 , where the architect (author of the answer) makes comment right inside the source code. This branch immediately goes into trunk , in revision 8 . The project manager returns the task back to the programmer and asks him to finish the task, since all answers are received and embedded in the source code. The programmer starts a new branch and implements the code she could not implement before. The programmer makes changes in revision 9 and the project manager merges them into trunk in 11 . The longest distance is 2 revisions and the risk of conflict during merging is much smaller than in Workflow B. It is obvious that a long-lasting branch (as in Workflow B) will cause higher risks of conflicts during merging into the trunk . With shorter branches, every programmer has more flexibility and freedom to make risky changes without a high risk of being rejected during merging.

Parallel programming in a distributed team is a tricky and risky process, especially if your project wants to be successful and delivered on time. Subversion helps isolate programmers in their branches, but when they start to reintegrate into trunk, conflicts may effectively ruin hours or days of work. Distributed development of software over the last decade has been growing in popularity. This is mostly due to the continuous improvement of the quality of communication channels and the emergence of new methods of interaction between us, in the Internet. Nowadays, brick-and-mortar offices become less effective when a software project requires the participation of engineers with different skills, experience, and price. One of the biggest problems in parallel programming is conflicts of source code. People tend to make chaotic changes and then later fail to merge their results with similar contributions made by others. Puzzle Driven Development (PDD) solves the problems, by means of using so called \"puzzles\" inside source code. More on this topic to be revealed later, when patent application is published by USPTO.

The key objective of the project was to get an effective system, which would allow registered users to make on-line advertisements more effective by means of creating, managing, tracking, controlling and reporting ad popularity and financial statistics. The main constraint of the project was the inconsistency of the customer's requirement amount and amount of the initial budget. That's why we decided to divide the scope of the whole system into several releases. The first release was to provide only minimal functionality of the system that would allow the customer to put it to work and earn some revenue. We also decided to separate the database and the main business functions from the user interface because we expected a high load of statistic modules (800-1200K queries a day). All control and statistic queries were to work through XML calls. First we tried to define the first release scope as all the advertisers' functions and some minor publishers' functions to make the system work. But with architecture elaboration we understood that the main project objective (get the ability to put the system to work and earn revenue) could not be reached while the Publisher's logic was not implemented. So we decided to define the first release scope as all main business logic, database structure and some minor user interface functions. This early architecture decomposition of the system saved 400 staff-hours that could be spent for later implementation of the Publishers' logic. It's very important for us to decide how a system will look before we start implementation. We usually spend a lot of time on system definition, architecture elaboration and decomposition.

There are several consecutive steps in a change control procedure: Requested change comes from you or project team (in any form). Project manager, with the help of system analyst and project team, analyzes the impact. The impact is estimated in staff-hours ( Cost ) and business days ( Schedule ). You approve or reject the estimation. New Specification is developed by the project team. Changes to Schedule, Risks , and Budget and are estimated and presented. You approve or reject the changes. When the above procedure is finished, the changes become effective and the project team works with the new Schedule, Budget and Risks.

Quality is measured as amount of defect-free functionality related to defective functionality. Quality is measured in percentages. Our contract says that 95% is acceptable Quality. A Defect is a non-conformity of Deliverables to Specification . In other words, the software product does not work as specified. Defects shall be revealed by the project team before software product is delivered to you. While you and end-users perceive Defects through software interfaces, the majority of Defects do not reside in software itself. This is where Defects normally lie (in order of severity): Software development contract Vision SRS Risk List Iteration Schedule and Plans Architecture Design Software code Test Plan Software code itself is one of the least critical components in the total Cost Of Quality structure. Defects in software code are the least expensive to remove. There are a number of prevention methods we use in order to reveal and remove Defects before they become critical or fatal. Peer reviews of SRS, Schedule, Risk List and architecture Prototyping on early Iterations Strict guidelines and manuals for analysts and architects Industry standards and formats (UML, IEEE, ISO, RUP, XML, etc.) Periodical Quality Assurance (QA) audits All prevention methods are used before unit-testing , system testing and manual testing . Prevention methods are performed by programmers and testers when software is being implemented.

We take all risks of cost overrun so that you pay only the price defined in project Budget . Our two-step quotation process has a number of important advantages: Final budget is optimal, without extra costs and reserves Guarantees \"win-win\" outcome for you and us Avoids cost overrun Guarantees project success We calculate and communicate all project costs in staff-hours. Actual monetary size of project is a multiple of staff-hours and price per hour . Cost is estimated in two steps: ROM Estimate and Retainer Budget The ROM Estimate is provided to you in response to your informal request and is based on the Vision document. ROM Estimate gives a range (low and high boundary) of the expected Budget. You approve the range and the project team performs requirements gathering and analysis during the Inception Phase . These steps result in the creation of a SRS document. When the SRS is ready and you approved it, the project team estimates project Budget as an exact amount of staff-hours. The Budget can only be within the range provided in ROM Estimate. Upon your approval of the Budget, the project continues. If you don't approve the Budget for any reason, you pay only the Retainer, which covers the efforts for Requirements gathering and Specification development. Payments are made according to Milestones defined in the Schedule , which is approved together with the Budget. Budget covers all costs, including programming, requirements analysis, management, project management, architecture and design, testing and quality assurance.

All Requirements are defined in a textual format based on the terms from the Glossary. A Glossary is used in order to avoid misinterpretation of key terms and definitions inside the Specification . Key terms, data units, and concepts are taken from Requirements and entered in the Glossary. This is a proven method to avoid ambiguity. Consider the following example of two simple functional requirements: # Requirement R1 User can send a [Request] for new account registration, System shall validate provided information and create a new [Account] for the user. R2 User can send a [Request] for [Password] change in their [Account], System shall change database records for the user. The following is an example of the Glossary terms for the Requirements shown above: Term Definition Used in [Request] Web form completion and submission operation performed by the user. Process is completed when the 'Submit' button is clicked. R1, R2 [Password] 6-20 characters connected with the user account. It must contain at least one numeric symbol and one capital letter. R2 [Account] Database record associated with the user, includes: Login, Password, Name, Phone, and Email. R1, R2 As evidenced by the example, the Glossary helps to define shared concepts of the system scope and work with it independently of the Requirements.

It is a long-lasting project with a wide scope of work. At the initial phase of the MESSQ project, scope was fixed by a document called \"Project Task\". This document had 80 pages and consisted of vague and unclear definitions. Our current principles proclaim that software requirements shall be correct, unambiguous, complete, consistent, verifiable, modifiable, and traceable. So the old style document became an obsolete document for scope management. But when we tried to modify the MESSQ \"Project Task\", we found out that direct transforming would take from MESSQ the cost of 100-120 hours, and this was not appropriate so completing the project would be unsatisfactory. Our decision was to write a new software specification, which would consist of requirements in the type of software \"defects\" for the time being. In other words, specification was built from inconsistencies between current the software product and the project task: one \"defect\" -- one requirement. So we used a type of gap analysis in order to compare and document actual project performance with its potential performance. The main attention was paid to the customer's opinion on scope integrity. Writing the new specifications cost 30 hours, which led to a cost savings of 70-80 hours. This described approach allows us to avoid risks related to vague requirements and save on cost and money. The joint work of project participants became dramatically easier after establishing the new type of specification. This document has 7 pages of clear and non-vague requirements. Consequently, working on each requirement for the software product (deliverables of MESSQ project) we met all of the customer expectations. The MESSQ project was successfully finished in time and even with a budget savings.

The project cost was 1302 s/h, the schedule -- 5 months. We chose an SVN system to store the company's data and PHP to implement the connection to this storage. Lessons learned from previous projects contained information about issues of open source SVN software. It was decided to plan on more testing of this feature. So we planned to find and fix double the amount of defects instead of the usual estimated number. This plan was correct and when the 100th bug was fixed, the system gained an acceptable quality level. Quantitative quality control is a powerful tool to manage a project's quality.

The estimated project cost was 1180 staff-hours, the schedule -- 4 months. The main technologies were Java, Flex and PHP. One of the first steps at the project start was deep risk analysis. More than 100 project risks were identified and assessed. Mitigation and contingency plans were created for the top 20 risks. One of the most interesting risk mitigation plans is described below. Existing software was delivered to us \"as is\", with no deployment process. There was a risk that manual deployment of every new build would cause great cost and schedule losses. The mitigation plan was to investigate used technologies and adjust the continuous integration process for the whole project. We found appropriable tools (NAnt and Maven) and completed the solution. As a result, our team members just had to commit source code to the repository. And in some minutes the compiled build was unit tested, auto-deployed and auto tested. This was a very efficient tool to develop this project on.

There were engineers from Poland, Belarus, Czech Republic, and United States. The team communicated only through Trac and Subversion, using FaZend.com Continuous Integration platform. The product is developed in PHP, with an extensive use of XML and JavaScript. We've used a number of frameworks and third-party tools, like PHPUnit, jQuery, JSLint, QUnit, Phing. The biggest challenge in the project was a necessity to invent the product, design it and develop at the same time. There were a number of risks related to this challenge. What helped us to mitigate the majority of risks is a Puzzle Driven Development concept, which was invented during that time and applied for USPTO patent.

The strategy for the key risks was mitigation. We had spent almost 1/3 of the total management cost for elaboration risk strategy and prediction of effects. Near to the end of schedule when the system was implemented (all 130 requirements were tested) we moved to stress and volume tests. 50 to 200 staff-hours were spent for those tests. Then \"acceptance testing\" followed. As mitigation for key risks we spent 150 (!) staff hours for acceptance testing. The whole system was deployed on a test-platform and provided to the customer. As planned, the customer began to make different remarks here and there, which were not in the SRS and were not important for functionality itself, but should be fixed any way as the customer said. With automatic and manual testing we found around 50 bugs, but the customer found around 100 small and big remarks. All his issues were registered as bugs and were fixed ASAP to start testing again. So, in total, risk management was correct and helped us to develop and send that system. The 150 staff-hours that were spent for acceptance testing were nothing near the big loses that could have happened to our company if we had done manual and automatic testing. As a result, the customer received his system and our company spent only that money that we planned at the beginning.

Poker-room is third-party software for us and additionally has very complex undocumented architecture with approximately 100 classes and 100 000 strings of source code.

Every new customizing order for poker room software needed 50-60 hours to change, recompile and integrate the multi-parts poker room project with the great risk of failure and unexpected errors. The customizing procedure was also worsened by long and undocumented deployment activity for each project component. All of the aforementioned problems led to great risk of failed customizing and lost money and time. The obvious decision for poker-room was architecture description, but our preliminary estimation stated it would take us up to 500 hours. So we decided to organize for all participants' integration environment. Our main goals were to reduce the cost of the integration work for deployment of the multi-parts project on a target customer server. We used Apache Continuum on a Windows server, R2build system and shell programs were developed for automation of the building and deployment stages. All components were adjusted and integrated for one time. We spent 400 hours, but it was a one time cost. After this when we obtain a system, it is not dependent on programmers and system administrators. All that is needed from programmers is to commit source code on a subversion server. The system administrator only has to put down the server parameters and then the system will go through all the building and deploying steps by itself while logging all errors and unplanned conditions. Now it takes about 2 hours for integration with the Windows exe servers, 1 hours to deploy the database structure with all stored procedures (on running MS SQL server) and PHP admin panel on Windows platform. Considered deployment automation allowed us to successfully execute many customizing projects for poker room software. This approach dramatically reduces many risks and simplifies integration management work under \"black box\" software as well as allows us to organize daily building for such third-party source code projects.

A Functional Requirement answers the question \"what should the system do\", and a Non-functional Requirement provides an answer to \"how will the system do this\"? Functional Requirements respond when the user makes a 'Request', causing the system to create a 'Reply'. A 'Request' is a formal interaction between the user and system through one of its external interfaces. A 'Reply' is the term for how the system reacts after receiving a Request from the user. Functional Requirements are supported with Non-functional Requirements, which are supplementary specifications in a SRS . Examples of Functional Requirements and their supplementary specifications include the following: # Requirement Supplementary R1 User can submit a Request to change the password associated with their account, the system shall generate a Reply by changing the database records for the user.

EV is equal to 345 staff-hours. PV is the result of 25/40 days that have been put into the project (0.625), and then multiplied by 615 staff-hours. PV equals to approximately 384 staff-hours. According to the plan, we have to deliver 384 accepted staff-hours to the customer on the 25th day of the project. SPI is calculated as EV/PV and equals to 345/384 = 0.898. That means that the project is behind schedule now and corrective actions are required. This example shows how the project can be tracked without excess technical details. This information (EV, PV and SPI) is presented to you at each Iteration Acceptance Meeting (by the end of each Iteration ) and is available instantly online in our management software. The SPI should always be equal to or greater than 1.0. This is a key aspect for the project manager. If an SPI is less than 1.0, the project manager immediately impelements corrective action, which could be one of the following (depending on other project characteristics): Add more resources Change the scope by moving requirements to the next release Re-estimate the project and approve a new Schedule and Budget (worst variant) The numbers presented by an Earned Value analysis help you, the project team, and project manager to stay on the same page during the course of the whole project.

However, average numbers (in correlation with the project Budget ) are as follows: Budget, staff-hours Functional Requirements SRS size, pages Efforts, staff-hours Time, weeks 1000-2200 40-130 20-60 150-280 3-5 1900-3500 100-400 40-100 200-400 4-7 3000-5000 350-700 80-200 350-700 5-9 Functional Requirements for the SRS are uniquely identified and used in a Traceability Matrix in order to provide backward traceability for Features.

You have to choose a strategy for each Risk that appears on the list. You have two options — either to pay for the implementation of a pro-active Mitigation Plan and eliminate the Risk, or to do nothing, but agree that if the Risk happens, you will assume responsibility later by paying for Contingency Plan. This following is an example of a possible Risk: Risk description Mitigation Plan Contingency Plan Data provider changes the API on its own schedule, without prior notification. The next change may happen before the project release Milestone, and the system won't work Develop a configurable XML-based integration module that will allow dynamic API changes without code re-factoring Integration module re-factoring The numbers for these different plans include: Plan Cost, staff-hours Duration, business days Mitigation Plan 140 7 Contingency Plan 280+ 10+ All of these numbers are provided to you prior to the commencement of the project. Thus, there is a choice of spending 140 staff-hours immediately to remove the Risk, or to do nothing, with the understanding the 280 or more hours may be required later at your expense. The first option is called mitigation and means that you are ready to spend time and money pro-actively in order to guarantee that the Risk will be removed. The second option is called acceptance , and means that you do not take any action, but is ready to pay later if the Risk does in fact happen. If the Risk never happens, you will never pay for it. If the Risk is not identified and is not listed in Risk List, the Risk is already mitigated, and bears no responsibility for you.

Nowadays in the software industry this happens during the course of many projects. We pay great attention to planning, monitoring, and controlling of time in our projects. Right after a ROM Estimate is approved and the project is started, we plan the Inception Phase . Usually, when the project is started, there is a lack of details about system requirements. Accurate planning can be done only after the scope definition and risk analysis are completed, that's why we need to conduct the Inception Phase before Schedule development. The main goal of our Inception Phase is to create Specification , identify Risks , calculate Budget , and build a Schedule. Sometimes, in order to define the Schedule, it's necessary to develop a baseline of key architectural software concepts during the Inception Phase. LCO Milestone happens following the end of Inception Phase, when the Specification is ready and a Schedule is defined. The Schedule is a one-page table that lists the Iterations and Milestones. As soon as the customer signs the Schedule, it obtains the status of a contractual provision and can't be missed. The objective of each Iteration is to implement, test, and deliver a certain part of the product functionality. Iteration normally takes 8-12 working days and starts with a fine-grained Iteration Plan, which is shown to you and is used to track the progress during the project. The Iteration Plan is focused on the Iteration objective as defined in the Schedule, and uses the WBS and Network Diagram methods for planning. By the end of each Iteration, we conduct an Iteration Acceptance Meeting, where a SPI is presented to you in conjunction with the risk monitoring results. The project is transparently monitored and tracked with an SPI, which is based on the functional requirements and their status of completion. Any changes to the Milestones will produce a new version of the Schedule, which you shall sign to make it effective.

Unit tests play an adhesive role between software modules and Requirements . Unit tests guarantee that in any moment all software modules work as they worked before, when the unit tests were created and executed. We exploit this powerful technology in all projects, no matter what platform or programming language is used. Unit testing gives a number of benefits to you: Software is self-verifiable A programmer change does not affect core refactoring Code is stable and predictable Software is scalable and supportable While the technology is very useful for any project, it requires additional time for design and development during early Iterations .

Customers also use their own format for documentation. Sometimes, such documentation is properly formatted and presented, and sometimes it is not. We use a uniform and standard format for the preliminary scope definition. It is short, simple, and very clear - we call it the Vision. The Vision document is a two page file that includes a description of the project, list of Features , key risks, assumptions, and architectural concepts. It is possible to present any product scope in this simple format, even if the product is very large. The Vision document is not a fully-dressed Specification and cannot be used by developers for the purpose of programming. The Vision is used by the system analyst, project manager, customer, and other stakeholders for the following reasons: To define the boundaries of the product. To gain an understanding of project goals. To identify key stakeholders and their needs. A system analyst usually spends up to five hours developing the Vision.
