    <meta name="description" content="The software package we had as a legacy from previous coders
didn&#39;t have a deployment mechanism. Manual deployment of
every consecutive build could take hours. We saw this as the
most critical risk. We had held a risk analysis meeting and
decided to mitigate this risk by a continuous integration
adjustment. The needed tools were found (Maven, nAnt) and
integrated into the whole auto-deployment mechanism. It took
just 5 minutes to build, test and deploy the system.
Finally, this made the project successful.

      <h1>Risk Mitigation Approach</h1>
      <p>The project objectives were to implement additional functionality to
the existing internet application. The new application features were:
bulk sms, sms subscriptions, a free sms sending feature with advertising
rotation, mobile content sharing and premium sms billing. The estimated
project cost was 1180 staff-hours, the schedule -- 4 months. The main
technologies were Java, Flex and PHP.</p>

<p>One of the first steps at the project start was deep risk analysis. More
than 100 project risks were identified and assessed. Mitigation
and contingency plans were created for the top 20 risks. One of the
most interesting risk mitigation plans is described below.</p>

<p class='tikz'><img src='/tikz/9cf601bdb1ff3fd293f78c630ae1b5ed.png' alt='tikz' width='80%'/></p>

<p>Existing software was delivered to us &quot;as is&quot;, with no deployment process.
There was a risk that manual deployment of every new build would cause great cost and schedule losses.</p>

<p>The mitigation plan was to investigate used technologies and adjust the continuous
integration process for the whole project. We found appropriable
tools (NAnt and Maven) and completed the solution.</p>

<p>As a result, our team members just had to commit source code
to the repository. And in some minutes the compiled build was unit tested,
auto-deployed and auto tested. This was a very efficient tool to
develop this project on.</p>
