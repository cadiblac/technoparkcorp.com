      <h1>Early Architecture Decomposition</h1>
      <p>The main project&#39;s outcome was an on-line ad serving program for
Advertisers and Publishers, which would give them the ability to manage
ads and financial statistics.</p>

<p>The key objective of the project was to get an effective system, which
would allow registered users to make on-line advertisements more effective
by means of creating, managing, tracking, controlling and reporting
ad popularity and financial statistics.</p>

<p>The main constraint of the project was the inconsistency of the customer&#39;s
requirement amount and amount of the initial budget. That&#39;s why we
decided to divide the scope of the whole system into several releases. The first
release was to provide only minimal functionality of the system that
would allow the customer to put it to work and earn some revenue.</p>

<p>We also decided to separate the database and the main business functions from the
user interface because we expected a high load of statistic modules
(800-1200K queries a day). All control and statistic queries were
to work through XML calls.</p>

<p class='tikz'><img src='/tikz/a2ae73f87bb60b7934f32f9b3bb23a49.png' alt='tikz' width='80%'/></p>

<p>First we tried to define the first release scope as all the advertisers&#39;
functions and some minor publishers&#39; functions to make the system
work. But with architecture elaboration we understood that the main project
objective (get the ability to put the system to work and earn revenue)
could not be reached while the Publisher&#39;s logic was not implemented.</p>

<p class='tikz'><img src='/tikz/c08abb11b3f25b8b7f35d5b9ece912b5.png' alt='tikz' width='80%'/></p>

<p>So we decided to define the first release scope as all main business
logic, database structure and some minor user interface functions.</p>

<p>This early architecture decomposition of the system saved 400 staff-hours
that could be spent for later implementation of the Publishers&#39; logic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very important for us to decide how a system will look before we start implementation. We usually spend a lot of time on
system definition, architecture elaboration and decomposition. In this
way we appreciably decrease project risk scores and save budget.</p>
