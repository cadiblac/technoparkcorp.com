      <h1>Automated Deployment Environment For Multi-parts Project</h1>
      <p>Poker-room is a multi player system for playing in different kinds of poker
throughout the Internet. Poker-room is third-party software for us and
additionally has very complex undocumented architecture with
approximately 100 classes and 100 000 strings of source code. So it is
a type of &quot;black box&quot; for us. Every new customizing order for poker
room software needed 50-60 hours to change, recompile and
integrate the multi-parts poker room project with the great risk of failure
and unexpected errors. The customizing procedure was also worsened by long
and undocumented deployment activity for each project component.  All
of the aforementioned problems led to great risk of failed customizing and lost money and time.</p>

<p>The obvious decision for poker-room was architecture description, but our
preliminary estimation stated it would take us up to 500 hours. So we
decided to organize for all participants&#39; integration environment.
Our main goals were to reduce the cost of the integration work for deployment of
the multi-parts project on a target customer server. We used Apache Continuum
on a Windows server, R2build system and shell programs were developed for
automation of the building and deployment stages. All components were
adjusted and integrated for one time. We spent 400 hours, but it
was a one time cost. After this when we obtain a system, it is not dependent
on programmers and system administrators.</p>

<p>All that is needed from programmers is to commit source code on a subversion
server. The system administrator only has to put down the server
parameters and then the system will go through all the building and deploying
steps by itself while logging all errors and unplanned conditions. Now it
takes about 2 hours for integration with the Windows exe servers, 1 hours to
deploy the database structure with all stored procedures (on running MS SQL
server) and PHP admin panel on Windows platform. Considered deployment
automation allowed us to successfully execute many customizing projects for
poker room software.</p>

<p>This approach dramatically reduces many risks and simplifies integration
management work under &quot;black box&quot; software as well as allows us to
organize daily building for such third-party source code projects.</p>
